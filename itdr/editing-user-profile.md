The user profile consists of your name and time zone. It is configured when an administrator provisions an account for you in the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal.
Zscaler ITDR uses your profile information to configure the portal as follows:
- Your name is displayed during specific configurations. It is also used when submitting a ticket to Zscaler Support.
- The time zone is used when sending automated email alerts.
To edit your user profile:
- On the **Accounts Settings** page, under **Edit Profile**, enter your name.
-
Select a **Time Zone** from the drop-down menu.
