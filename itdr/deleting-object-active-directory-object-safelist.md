To delete an AD object from the safelist:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Settings** > **Active Directory** **Object Safelist**.
- Select an AD domain from the **Result for** drop-down menu.
-
Under **Actions**, click the **Delete** icon to remove the object from the safelist.

In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
When you remove an object from the safelist, it gets added to the [Focus Area](/itdr/viewing-focus-area-details) page and the new and previous [vulnerability reports](/itdr/viewing-vulnerability-report) for the selected issue.
