After you [configure an endpoint](/itdr/configuring-endpoint-credential-exposure-scan) for a credential exposure scan, the scan is triggered at the scheduled time. When new endpoint agents are installed, or when you need to scan an endpoint for risks to view the report immediately, you can manually trigger an on-demand scan.
To trigger an on-demand credential exposure scan:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Manage** > **Endpoint Credential Exposure**.
-
Locate the endpoint you want to scan manually, and click the **Trigger a new scan** icon.
[See image.](#itdr-run-on-demand-credential-scan)
- In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
The scan is triggered for the endpoint. After the scan is complete, you can view the results on the [Endpoint Credential Exposure](/itdr/about-endpoint-credential-exposure-dashboard) dashboard.
