In addition to the default changes detected by Zscaler ITDR in your Entra ID tenant, you can configure custom policies to detect changes in the Entra ID tenant based on properties such as users, service principals, and roles. You can also notify specific users via email when these changes are detected.
Entra ID Change Detection policies provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Monitor Entra ID tenants for specific changes by creating custom policies based on users, service principals, and roles.
- Notify users via email when the changes are detected.
