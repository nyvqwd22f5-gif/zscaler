You can change or reset your password for security reasons.
To change the password:
- On the **Accounts Settings** page, under **Change Password**, enter your **Current Password**.
- Enter your **New Password**, and then enter it again in the **Confirm New Password **field.
An estimator is used to determine the password strength. The color meter below **New Password** indicates the password strength. For example, a green line indicates a strong password and a red line indicates a weak password.

After the password is changed, you will receive a confirmation email.
