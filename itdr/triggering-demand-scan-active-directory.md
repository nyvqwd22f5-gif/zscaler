After you [configure an Active Directory (AD) domain for scanning](/itdr/scanning-active-directory), the scan is triggered at the scheduled time. If you need to immediately scan an AD domain for risks and view the report, you can manually trigger an on-demand scan.
To trigger an on-demand AD scan:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Manage** > **Active Directory Posture**.
-
Locate the AD domain for which you want to manually scan, and click the **Trigger a new scan** icon.
[See image.](#deception-run-on-demand-scan)
-
In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
The scan is triggered for the selected AD domain. After the scan is complete, you can view the results on the [Active Directory Posture](/itdr/about-active-directory-posture-dashboard) dashboard.
