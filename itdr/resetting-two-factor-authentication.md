When signing in to the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal for the first time, you must configure two-factor authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app. This adds an extra level of security because you are required to enter both your password and a 2FA code while signing in to the portal.
When you have a new device and you want to configure 2FA on it, you can reset the code.
To reset 2FA:
- On the **Accounts Settings** page, under **Two-Factor Authentication**, click **Reset 2FA**.
-
Enter your **Password** and the **Current 2FA code** that appears on the authenticator app.

- Click **Save**.
- When a QR code appears, scan it using an authenticator app.
-
Enter the one-time password (OTP). This is the 6-digit code shown on the authenticator app.
