You can view Active Directory (AD) change detection issues that are added to the safelist. You can also view additional details about each change detection issue and manage them.
To view the Active Directory Change Detection Issue Safelist:
- Go to **ITDR **>** Settings **> **AD** **Change Detection Issue Safelist**.
-
Select an AD domain from the **Result for** drop-down menu.
The **Change Detection Issue Safelist** page appears. For each issue that is marked as safe, you can view:
- **Name**: The change detection issue name.
- **Created On**: The date when the change detection issue was added to the safelist.
- **Created By**: The name of the user who added the change detection issue to the safelist.
- **Reason**: The reason why the change detection issue was added to the safelist.
