You can integrate Zscaler ITDR with various third-party data enrichment solutions to add relevant contextual information to the security events that are generated in the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal.
Enrichment integration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Obtain meaningful insights into the security event logs generated in the ITDR Admin Portal. For example, events can be enriched with contextual information from geolocation tools, third-party threat intelligence databases, sandbox analysis reports, etc.
- Reduce false positives, which allows you to manage security threats efficiently.
