The Risk Summary dashboard consolidates top or critical misconfigurations and vulnerabilities from various identity management solutions, such as Active Directory (AD), Entra ID, etc. to provide a broad data-driven overview of risk posture. It also identifies the top endpoint credential exposures contributing to the identity risk posture. The interactive widgets on the dashboard help you to view the entire risk profile of your identity environment, drill down to specific critical risk, and remediate the issue. You can also view issue mappings to security risk frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK.
The Risk Summary dashboard provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View a snapshot of the risk posture of your entire identity environment.
- Quickly prioritize issues with critical severity that are easy to remediate across the identity environment.
- Understand the risk composition along with actionable insights and recommendations.
- Remediate issues with critical severity and reduce the risk score to improve the risk posture.
About the Risk Summary Dashboard
On the Risk Summary dashboard (ITDR > Dashboard > Risk Summary), you can do the following:
- In the **Active Directory** widget, select an AD domain from the drop-down menu. You can:
- View a unified risk score of the AD domain on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is critical.
- View a graph that shows the risk score for the AD domain over a period of time.
- View the top 3 issues with critical severity that are found in the AD domain. These are issues and misconfigurations that have the highest impact on your risk score and are the easiest to remediate. If you fix these issues first, you can significantly reduce your risk score. Click an issue to go to the [AD detailed findings and recommendations page](/itdr/viewing-focus-area-details).
- Click **View All Critical Issues** to go to the [AD detailed findings and recommendations page](/itdr/viewing-focus-area-details) to view additional details about all critical issues to further investigate and remediate.
- In the **Entra ID** widget, select an Entra ID tenant from the drop-down menu. You can:
- View a unified risk score of the Entra ID tenant on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is critical.
- View a graph that shows the risk score for the Entra ID tenant over a period of time.
- View the top 3 issues with critical severity that are found in the tenant. These are issues and misconfigurations that have the highest impact on your risk score and are the easiest to remediate.

- View the security posture of your endpoints. From the **Credential Exposure** widget, you can:
- View the total number of identities storing endpoint credential exposure issues.
- View a graph that shows the total number of credentials exposed on the scanned endpoints scanned over a period of time.
- View the top 3 exposed endpoint credentials with critical severity. These are issues and misconfigurations that pose the greatest risk of exploitation and enable lateral movement. Having visibility into these riskiest exposed credentials helps you prioritize what to focus on first and reduce the risk of exploitation. Click an exposure to go to the [Endpoint Credential Exposure detailed findings page](/itdr/viewing-exposed-endpoint-credential-detailed-findings-and-recommendations-details).
- Click **View All Critical Issues **to go to the [Endpoint Credential Exposure detailed findings page](/itdr/viewing-exposed-endpoint-credential-detailed-findings-and-recommendations-details) to view all exposed credentials to further investigate and remediate.
- View all the risks mapped to MITRE ATT&CK  exposure techniques and displayed on a kill chain. The **MITRE ATT&CK  Technique Exposure** widget enables you to get visibility into issues that can be exploited by adversaries during various stages of an attack in the event of a compromise. You can hover over the kill chain to view all techniques and issues. Click an issue pertaining to [AD](/itdr/viewing-issue-details-grouped-mitre-attck-techniques), [Entra ID](/itdr/viewing-entra-id-issue-details-grouped-mitre-attck-techniques), or [credential exposure](/itdr/viewing-exposed-credential-grouped-mitre-attack-techniques) to view additional details about the issue for further investigation and remediation.
- Obtain a direct insight into the potential risks associated with your AD domains. Click **Go to Active Directory Risk Dashboard** to view the [Identity Posture dashboard](/itdr/about-identity-posture-dashboard). From the **Active Directory Risk At-a-glance** widget, you can:
- View the total number of AD objects (users and computers) that pose critical risk of exploitation.
- View a bubble chart that depicts the distribution of risk types in your AD domains. The size of a bubble represents the proportion of that risk type in your AD domains. The larger the bubble, that particular risk type poses the highest risk in your AD domains. You can click a bubble to view all the issues for that risk type for further investigation and remediation. Click **View All Risky Objects** to [view all the issues categorized by risk type](/itdr/viewing-issue-details-grouped-risk-type).
- View the top 10 users and computers that have the highest risks in the AD domains. Having visibility of these 10 riskiest objects in your AD helps you to prioritize what to focus on first. Click View **All Users and Computers** to view the details of all AD objects categorized by risk type and severity.
- View the details of the recent attacks on the AD objects. Click **Investigate All Active Directory Attacks** to go to the Investigate page. This page is an interactive and graphical representation of real-time alerts that are the primary indicators of attacker activities.
- Obtain a direct insight into the potential risks associated with your Entra ID tenants. Click **Go to Entra ID Dashboard** to view the [Entra ID dashboard](/itdr/about-entra-id-dashboard). From the **Entra Risk At-a-glance** widget, you can:
- View the total number of Entra ID objects (users, service principals, and configuration settings) that pose critical risk of exploitation.
- View a bubble chart that depicts the distribution of risk types in your Entra ID tenants. The size of a bubble represents the proportion of that risk type in your tenant. The larger the bubble, that particular risk type poses the highest risk in your Entra ID tenants. You can click a bubble to view all the issues for that risk type for further investigation and remediation. Click **View All Risky Objects** to view all the [issues categorized by risk type](/itdr/viewing-entra-id-issue-details-grouped-severity).
