In addition to the default changes detected by Zscaler ITDR in your Active Directory (AD) domain, you can configure custom policies to detect changes in the AD domain based on properties such as users, groups, and computers. You can also notify specific users via email when these changes are detected.
Active Directory Change Detection policies provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Monitor an AD domain for specific changes by creating custom policies based on users, groups, and computers.
- Notify users via email when the changes are detected.
