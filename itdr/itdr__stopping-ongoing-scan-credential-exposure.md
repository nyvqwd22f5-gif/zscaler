After you [configure an endpoint](/itdr/configuring-endpoint-credential-exposure-scan) for a credential exposure scan, and it is in progress, you can temporarily stop the scan. When you want to update Zscaler ITDR software or configure endpoints for any changes, you can temporarily stop an ongoing or scheduled scan. Existing scans that are in progress will be completed, but no new scheduled scans will run until you start them.
To stop an ongoing credential exposure scan:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Manage** > **Endpoint Credential Exposure**.
-
Locate the endpoint with the scan that you want to stop, and click the **Stop **icon.

-
In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
A confirmation message appears indicating that the scan is stopped. The scan is stopped until you start it again.
Click the **Start** icon to start the scan.
