After you [scan](/itdr/triggering-demand-scan-entra-id) an Entra ID tenant, the issues are listed under the [Focus Areas](/itdr/viewing-entra-id-focus-area-details) section on the [Entra ID dashboard](/itdr/about-entra-id-dashboard). You can review these issues to confirm that they are not a risk and mark them as safe.
Adding issues to the safelist impacts the unified risk score on the [Entra ID dashboard](/itdr/about-entra-id-dashboard).
The Entra ID Issue Safelist provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View the list of issues that don't pose a risk and are marked safe.
- Ensure that the risk score on the [Entra ID dashboard](/itdr/about-entra-id-dashboard) reflects the actual risk.
