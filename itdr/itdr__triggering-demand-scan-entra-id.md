The posture scan schedule is configured at the time of adding an Entra ID tenant to the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal. You can launch the posture scan of an Entra ID tenant and view reports immediately.
To trigger an on-demand scan for an Entra ID tenant:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Manage** > **Entra ID**.
-
Locate the Entra ID tenant that you want to scan, and click the **Trigger Scan **icon under the **Actions **column.

-
In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
The scan is triggered for the Entra ID tenant. After the scan is complete, you can view the results on the [Entra ID Posture](/itdr/about-entra-id-posture-dashboard) dashboard.
Alternatively, you can trigger an on-demand scan directly from the [Entra ID Posture](/itdr/about-entra-id-posture-dashboard) dashboard.
