On the [Event Logs](/itdr/viewing-extended-details) page, you can see all the events associated with a particular entity, such as attackers or endpoints. You can mark these events as safe if you recognize them as a legitimate event. For example, you can mark an event as safe if the event was generated due to testing activity.
To mark events as safe:
-
On the [extended details](/itdr/viewing-extended-details) page of an entity from the dashboard, click **Event Logs**.
The **Event Logs** page appears.
- On the **Event Logs** page, select the events that you want to mark as safe.
-
Select the **Mark as safe **option from the **Actions **drop-down menu.

-
Confirm your action.
The selected events are marked as safe.
