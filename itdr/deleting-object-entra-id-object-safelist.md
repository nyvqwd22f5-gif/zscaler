- Select a tenant from the **Result for** drop-down menu.
-
Under **Actions**, click the **Delete** icon to remove the object from the safelist.

-
In the confirmation window, click **OK**.
When you remove an object from the safelist, it gets added to the [Focus Areas](/itdr/viewing-entra-id-focus-area-details) page and the new and previous [vulnerability reports](/itdr/viewing-entra-id-vulnerability-report) for the selected issue.
