The Endpoint Credential Exposure dashboard summarizes the security posture of your endpoints. The dashboard provides visibility into exposed endpoint credentials. You can investigate risks and [clean up the exposed credentials](/itdr/cleaning-exposed-endpoint-credentials) to protect the endpoints from external attack.
The Endpoint Credential Exposure dashboard provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Obtain visibility into credential exposure and vulnerabilities that exist on your endpoints.
- Investigate the identities that are compromised.
- View the domain risk severity and leverage the remediation reduction roadmap to lower the risk severity level.
- View remediation guidance and clean up exposed credentials to make the endpoints less vulnerable to identity-based attacks.
About the Endpoint Credential Exposure Dashboard
On the Endpoint Credential Exposure dashboard (ITDR > Dashboard > Endpoint Credential Exposure), you can do the following:
- Filter scan results by dates.
- [Download the endpoint executive report in the PDF](/itdr/downloading-endpoint-credential-exposure-executive-report).
- [Download the endpoint credential exposure scan data.](/itdr/downloading-endpoint-credential-exposure-report)
- View the total number of endpoints assessed in your system.
- View the total number of identities containing credential exposure issues.
- View the severity of risk for the exposed credentials, categorized as **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**. The risk posture improves as the severity level decreases.
- View the top 5 exposed credentials found on the endpoints. The findings help you prioritize and remediate the issues to reduce the risk severity. Click an exposed credential to view additional details.
- View the [top 10 identities](/itdr/viewing-identities-endpoint-exposures) that have credential exposure issues. Having visibility of these identities helps you to prioritize what to focus on first.
- View all exposed credentials categorized by severity in a bar chart.
- View all exposed credentials categorized by risk type (e.g., **Browser Credentials**, **Windows Credentials**, **Privilege Escalation**, etc.) in a donut chart, represented as percentages.
- View the [Risk Reduction Roadmap](/itdr/viewing-exposed-endpoint-credential-risk-reduction-roadmap) to see the current and target risk score and set targets to systematically lower the risk severity by providing a prioritized remediation road map.
