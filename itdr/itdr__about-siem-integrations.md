Zscaler ITDR seamlessly integrates with leading security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to enhance your security operations workflows. You can integrate ITDR with supported SIEM solutions to transmit event logs in real time. SIEM integration provides visibility in a centralized console and allows your teams to leverage the solution’s existing security investigation workflows.
Integrations with SIEM solutions provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Transmit event logs generated by ITDR to SIEM tools for real-time analysis of the log data in a centralized view.
- Monitor your network to gain visibility into suspicious activities, potential threats, and attacks, and respond to security incidents efficiently.
- Ensure that your organization meets auditing requirements and regulatory compliance standards.
