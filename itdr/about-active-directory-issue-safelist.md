After you scan an Active Directory (AD) domain, the issues are listed under the [Focus Area](/itdr/viewing-focus-area-details) section on the [Identity Posture](/itdr/about-identity-posture-dashboard) dashboard. You can review these issues to confirm that it is not a risk and mark them as safe.
Adding issues to the safelist impacts the unified risk score on the [Identity Posture](/itdr/about-identity-posture-dashboard) dashboard.
Active Directory Issue Safelist provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Review the issue that does not pose a risk and mark it as safe.
- Reduce the unified risk score on the [Identity Posture](/itdr/about-identity-posture-dashboard) dashboard.
