After you [scan an Active Directory (AD) domain](/itdr/scanning-active-directory), you can view the details of failed scan checks, if any.
To view the details of failed scan checks:
- Go to **ITDR** > **Manage **> **Active Directory Posture**.
- For a scanned AD Domain whose **Last Scan Status** is **Scan Completed **and some of the scan checks have failed, click the fractional number. For example, click **18/31**, which indicates that 18 scan checks out of 31 have failed.
The **Failed Scans** window appears with the following information:
- **Name**: The name of the scan check that failed.
- **Type**: The type of failure.
- **Reason**: The reason for failure.
