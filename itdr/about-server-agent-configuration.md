Server agent configuration in the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal allows you to set specific keywords for analyzing the strength and vulnerability of passwords. Based on the configured keywords, you can imitate an adversary's password cracking techniques, ensuring a stronger and more secure system.
The analysis is performed locally on the selected domain controller, ensuring that data stays secure.
Server agent configuration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Identify weak or vulnerable passwords, allowing you to take corrective action and prevent potential breaches.
- Imitate adversaries' password-cracking strategies.
