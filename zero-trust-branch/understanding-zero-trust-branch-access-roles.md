Zero Trust Branch uses role-based access control (RBAC) to determine the granted permissions that enable admins and users to perform their job functions. By separating duties across clearly defined roles, RBAC minimizes the risk of misconfigurations, unauthorized access, and insider threats while maintaining operational efficiency and compliance.
Working with Zero Trust Branch Roles
Beginning with version 8.0.1, Zero Trust Branch is enabled with ZIdentity as its sole identity and authentication management service. To add and manage Zero Trust Branch users and user groups, log in to the ZIdentity Admin Portal and select the Zero Trust Branch service. To learn more, see [Assigning Entitlements to Users and User Groups](/zidentity/assigning-entitlements-users-and-user-groups).
Predefined Roles
Zero Trust Branch does not have custom roles. The following predefined roles are available:
- **Super Admin**: The super admin has the highest level of privileges. This role has full access to security policy configuration, network settings (including routing and VLANs), site and template management, as well as user account creation and administration. Super admins are authorized to audit system logs, apply firmware updates, initiate failover operations, and restore the system as required. Given its broad access scope, this role is typically reserved for trusted system admins with comprehensive oversight responsibilities.
- **Network Admin**: The network admin is responsible for configuring and maintaining all network-related components. This includes managing interfaces, IP addressing, routing protocols, VLAN assignments, and[ Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) configurations](/zero-trust-branch/managing-snmp-configurations). This role ensures reliable network connectivity and optimal performance, while operating independently of the platform's security policy configurations.
- **Security Admin**: The security admin is tasked with managing and enforcing the platform's overall security posture. Core responsibilities include the definition and implementation of security policies, continuous monitoring of logs and alerts, and the fine-tuning of countermeasures to safeguard against both external and internal threats. In addition to policy management, the security admin is authorized to initiate device quarantine actions in response to anomalous or malicious activity. This role is also responsible for triggering the [Ransomware Kill Switch](/zero-trust-branch/about-ransomware-kill-switch), which isolates compromised endpoints and restricts lateral movement to prevent the spread of attacks across the site.
- **Viewer**: The viewer role grants users read-only access, including access to associated logs. This role is typically assigned to personnel responsible for auditing, reporting, or oversight functions. Viewers cannot alter any configuration settings, ensuring that the integrity and stability of the system is not compromised.
