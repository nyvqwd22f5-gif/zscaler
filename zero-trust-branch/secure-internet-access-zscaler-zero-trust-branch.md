The Zscaler Reference Architecture series delivers best practices based on real-world deployments. The recommendations in this series were developed by Zscaler's transformation experts from across the company. This guide will steer you through the architecture process and provide technical deep dives into specific platform functionality and integrations. The Zscaler Reference Architecture series is designed to be modular, so this guide will show you how to configure a different aspect of the platform in order to allow you meet your specific policy goals.
Zscaler Zero Trust Branch takes a different approach to the SD-WAN model. It starts with a Zero Trust approach to the branch office, using the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) model. Leveraging both Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), users gain access to applications, not networks. Designed to be deployed anywhere, from small branches to large campuses and data centers, Zero Trust Branch simplifies connecting your devices with the Zscaler cloud, the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE).
