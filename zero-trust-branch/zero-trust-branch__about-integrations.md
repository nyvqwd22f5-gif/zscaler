Zero Trust Branch integrates with third-party and Zscaler services to extend visibility, automate response workflows, and enrich analytics across your enterprise systems. You can integrate Zero Trust Branch with other tools from a centralized interface in the Zero Trust Branch Admin Portal. The supported integrations include tools for monitoring, security orchestration, IT service management, and analytics.
Integrations provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Unify monitoring and analytics across your environment by forwarding data to external tools such as security information and event management systems (SIEMs), SNMP dashboards, and Kibana for richer operational insights.
- Automate incident response and IT workflows by integrating with platforms, such as ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne to streamline ticketing, alerting, and remediation.
- Enhance security intelligence and visibility by correlating telemetry with third-party and Zscaler services, helping to identify threats faster and reduce response time.
