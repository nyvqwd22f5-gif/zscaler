To initiate the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process, submit a Zero Trust Branch ticket via the [Zscaler Help Portal](https://help.zscaler.com/submit-ticket-links). Zscaler Support works with you to troubleshoot and diagnose issues remotely.

- Shipping address
- Contact name, phone number, and email address
- Product model, serial, and asset tag numbers
- Creates an RMA number for tracking purposes.
- Ships a replacement device with a return shipping label included.
A return shipping label is included with the replacement device. You must package the defective device and ship it to Zscaler within 30 business days of receiving the replacement device. All returned items must have a valid Zscaler RMA number. This number is crucial to ensure the accurate tracking and handling of returned items. For any questions related to RMA or shipping, contact the Zscaler logistics team at [z-sc-logistics@zscaler.com](mailto:z-sc-logistics@zscaler.com).
