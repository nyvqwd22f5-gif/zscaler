After you receive the Zscaler Zero Trust Branch hardware, you can mount the Zero Trust Branch appliance as follows:
- The Zero Trust Branch ZT-400: Rack posts using the rack mount kit. (Only available by request.)

- The Zero Trust Branch ZT-800:

Mounting on a rack or wall optimizes your workspace and makes your Zero Trust Branch appliance more accessible for[ installation and deployment](/zero-trust-branch/deploying-zero-trust-branch). It protects your appliance from any external damage and helps streamline the organization of your cables and power adapters. Additionally, rack or wall mounting helps ensure proper airflow, preventing overheating and dust accumulation caused by restricted ventilation. Proper airflow also maintains a cleaner environment, prolonging the lifespan of the appliance.
