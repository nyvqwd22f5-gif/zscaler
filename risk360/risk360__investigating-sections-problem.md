When you click on the Investigate link for a section on the [Explore](/risk360/exploring-problems) page, you are redirected to the Investigate page where you can view the data shown in the section in detail for each asset involved in the section (e.g., server, ports, etc.). You can filter the table using the available filter options to narrow your search. The filter options vary based on the section that you investigate.
If available, you can include or exclude an entity in the table from risk score computation by providing an explanation:
-
Enable or disable the **Include** toggle of your choice.
[See image.](#inculde-option)
-
Click **Save**.
The **Entity Override Note** window appears.
-
In the **Entity Override Note** window, provide an explanation as to why you chose to include or exclude the entity.

-
Click **Save**.
You can modify the **Include** toggle for multiple entities at once and provide an explanation in the same **Entity Override Note** window.
The changes made by the admin are captured in the [audit logs](/risk360/about-audit-logs) with the username and reason provided for the override.
