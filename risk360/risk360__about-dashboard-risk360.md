The Dashboard page gives visibility and insight into your organization's risk score, contributed by various underlying factors such as exposed servers, recent malware outbreaks, segmentation posture, and data uploads to risky applications. Zscaler's architecture quantifies these events across 4 major categories, such as exposure of attack surfaces, asset compromise, lateral propagation, and sensitive data loss. You can study how your organization's risk score has changed over time and compare your score against industry peers. Different risk factors bear different weights on the score. For example, an active infection is more severe than a blocked access attempt to a blocked destination.
The dashboard provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Analyze your organization's risk score change over time and against your industry peers to understand your risk exposure against potential cyber attacks.
- Configure stronger policies for your organization, location, and user-level risk exposures as per Zscaler's recommendations to attain a healthy risk score.
About the Dashboard Page
On the Dashboard page, you can view the following sections:
- **Organization Risk Score**: The section shows the Zscaler-computed risk score for your organization and the industry peer average risk score. Your organization's risk score is an average risk score across 4 categories, i.e., External Attack Surface, Compromise, Lateral Propagation, and Data Loss. You can study how the risk score has changed over time and compare your score against your industry peers. The following severities appear for the score ranges:
- Low (0–25)
- Medium (26–50)
- High (51–75)
- Critical (76–100)
Hover over the dollar symbol to view the financial risk estimates. You can click **View Details **to further analyze it; you are redirected to the [Financial Risk](/risk360/about-financial-risk) page.
- **Risk Score Trend**: The graph shows the Zscaler-computed and industry peer average risk score trend for the last 90 days. Hover over a point in the graph to view the risk score for that date. You can select to view the risk trend for a specific risk score type by using the checkboxes at the bottom of the graph. Click:
- The **Settings **icon (![Peer Score Settings](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/risk360-draft-articles/about-dashboard-risk360/Risk360-Peer-Score-Settings.png)

- The **Download **icon (![Download icon for risk score trend](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/risk360-draft-articles/about-dashboard-risk360/Risk360-Peer-Score-Download.png)
) to download the risk score trend data as a CSV file.
- The **Expand **icon (![Expand Icon](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/risk360-draft-articles/about-dashboard-risk360/Risk360-Expand.png)
) to view significant events that contributed to your risk score in an enlarged view.
- [Enlarged View](#enlarged-view)
- **Risk Event by Location**: The map shows a category-based number of risky events from geolocation coordinates derived by looking at the client or server IP. As geo-IP lookups are only possible for a subset of overall risky events, the location visualizations represent a small fraction of overall risky events, but the map view allows you to visualize the geospatial distribution of risky events wherever possible. Hover over a location to view the number of risky events across each category. Use the mouse to drag within the maps or zoom in (+) and out (-). The bottom left of the section shows the top risky locations with the percentage of risky events in descending order.
- **Contributing Factors by Entity**: This section shows the total number of contributing factors from each entity. The circle chart shows the segregation across each category affected by these factors:
- **Workforce**: The factors contributing to the risk score due to risky user activity.
- **3rd Parties**: The factors contributing to the risk score due to activities by 3rd-party users (e.g., contract workers).
- **Applications**: The factors contributing to the risk score due to the usage of unsanctioned or less secure SaaS applications.
- **Assets**: The factors contributing to the risk score due to exposed organizational assets.
Hover over the circle chart to view the number of factors from each category and the percentage contribution to the total number of factors in that entity. You can click **View All **to further analyze it; you are redirected to the** **[Factors](/risk360/about-factors) page.
- **Top 10 Factors**: View top 10 factors contributing to your organization's risk score. For each factor, you can view the following information:
- **Category**: The category the factor falls under.
- **Factor Name**: The name of the contributing factor affecting the risk score.
- **Your Score**: The score for the contributing factor. The total score for a factor depends on its severity (0 being a healthy score).
- **Last 30 Days**: The graph showing the last 30-day score trend for that factor.
- **Entities**: The entities affected by the factor.
- **Licensed?**: Whether you are subscribed to the required feature to implement the recommended action (**Y** for Yes and **N** for No).
- **Recommended Actions**: The recommended action required to lower the risk score.
You can click **View All **to further analyze it; you are redirected to the** **[Factors](/risk360/about-factors) page.
- **High Impact Recommendations**: The section shows top factors with high impact on your risk score and the recommendation to lower your organization's risk score. Each recommendation consists of the category name, the day it was discovered, the consequence of not implementing the recommendation, and the trend (if applicable). You can click **Explore **to further analyze a particular recommendation or click **View All** to view the list of all the recommended actions; you are redirected to the [Insights](/risk360/about-insights-risk360) page.
