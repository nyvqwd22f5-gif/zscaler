You can customize the operating entity settings to set the entity source based on which Operating Entity Risk Report is generated for your organization.
To customize the parameters:
- Go to the **Account** page.
-
In the **Operating Entity Settings** section:
- **User-to-Operating Entity Mapping Source**: Select the operating entity source. Currently, only Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) is supported as the source.
- **Operating Entity Type**: Select the entity type as **Departments** or **Groups**.
[See image.](#op-entity-settings)
- Click **Save**.
The settings are successfully saved, and the next [Operating Entity Risk Report](/risk360/downloading-risk-reports) is generated based on the newly saved settings.
