- **Auto Refresh Dashboard?**: Enable the dashboards to automatically refresh every 15 minutes.
- **Policy Information**: Enable to display policy descriptions at the top of each policy window in the Risk360 Admin Portal.
- **Timezone**: When the Zscaler service saves transactions, it uses UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The time zone is used only for exporting logs to CSV files. It does not affect the generated logs in the Risk360 Admin Portal because the system time zone determines the time stamp of the generated logs.
