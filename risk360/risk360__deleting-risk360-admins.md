This article describes how to delete individual admin accounts in the Risk360 Admin Portal. The default admin account that has full access to the Risk360 Admin Portal and scope over the entire organization can't be deleted.
To delete an admin:
- Go to **Administration **>** Administrator Management**.
- Click the **Edit** icon for the admin you want to delete.

- Click **Delete**.

The **Confirm Changes** window appears.
- In the **Confirm Changes** window, click:
- **Yes**: To delete the admin and also remove the [user account](/zia/about-users) in the ZIA Admin Portal.
-
**No**: To delete the admin, but keep the [user account](/zia/about-users) intact in the ZIA Admin Portal.
Zscaler recommends you click **No **because if a user's account in the ZIA Admin Portal is deleted, the user loses all their Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) user privileges.
