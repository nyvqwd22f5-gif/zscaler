In today's world, cyber attackers are always searching for vulnerabilities and attack surfaces to exploit. Hence, the measuring, quantifying, and remediating of risk is becoming more and more significant and challenging at the same time. This entire process requires assistance from a variety of tools, such as vulnerability management software, attack surface reports from vendors, compliance systems, and metrics from manually entered error-prone spreadsheets.
Risk360 is a 360-degree risk management platform that not only provides holistic risk measurement data but also quantifies and helps remediate high-risk activities from various entities, configurations, and external attack surface data to provide the most comprehensive and actionable risk framework the industry has to offer. Furthermore, it helps mitigate risk exposure by providing actionable recommendations through intuitive workflows. The underlying architecture of Risk360 is an advancement of Zscaler's progressive features, such as the [User Risk Score](/zia/user-risk-report), [Company Risk Score](/zia/company-risk-score-report), [Configuration Risk Score](/zia/cyber-risk-report), etc.
Your organization's risk score is computed across your subscribed Zscaler services, such as Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), etc., and also integrates risk data from external vulnerability softwares. Risk360 analyzes your organization's security data and provides real-time risk metrics to emerge as the industry standard for risk quantification. The risk is measured and quantified across 4 major factors:
- **External Attack Surface**: Analyzes external attack surfaces across a range of publicly discoverable variables, such as exposed servers and autonomous system numbers (ASNs) to determine vulnerable cloud assets.
- **Compromise**: Analyzes events, security configurations, and traffic flow attributes to compute the likelihood of a compromise.
- **Lateral Propagation**: Analyzes various private access settings and metrics to compute lateral propagation risks.
- **Data Loss**: Analyzes sensitive data attributes to determine potential data leakage risks.
Key Features and Benefits
The key features and benefits of Risk360 are as follows:
- **Ease of Deployment**: Integration with the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) allows for seamless deployment. Risk360 is scalable and requires minimal on-premises computing. It does not require additional hardware upgrades.
- **Instant Discovery**: Start viewing risk metrics computed for your Zscaler environment and remediate them with ease.
- **Holistic Solution**: Provides a holistic risk analysis and displays risk metrics from various perspectives to encompass different business-level risk exposures.
Zscaler requests you read through the Risk360 service disclaimer before using the service. To learn more, see [Risk360 - Disclaimer](/risk360/risk360-disclaimer).
