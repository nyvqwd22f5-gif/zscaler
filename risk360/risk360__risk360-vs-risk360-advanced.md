Risk360 Advanced provides a holistic view of your organization's cyber risk posture by taking into consideration both Zscaler and non-Zscaler telemetry. The service helps with risk measurement & quantification across 4 major categories: External Attack Surface, Compromise, Lateral Propagation, and Data Loss analyzed in the form of risk factors.
If you're subscribed to [Experience Center](/unified/upgrading-zscaler-experience-center), a subset of Risk360 Advanced (i.e., Risk360) is enabled for your organization, which provides risk quantification and measurement based on the Zscaler telemetry only. To learn more, see the Risk360 Help.
The Risk360 Advanced service is an upgrade which elevates your risk visibility for both Zscaler and non-Zscaler technology and enables other progressive features such as:
- Built-in and custom risk factors that consider both Zscaler and non-Zscaler technologies (i.e., Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable).
- A Monte Carlo Simulation for quantifying risk in financial terms.
- Compliance frameworks to streamline your organization's compliance efforts (i.e., MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001).
- Custom reporting and dashboards.
- An alerting mechanism for timely notification triggers for various criteria (i.e., changes in risk score at the organization, factor group, and factor levels, and changes in potential financial loss).
- External surface analysis for multiple domains.
