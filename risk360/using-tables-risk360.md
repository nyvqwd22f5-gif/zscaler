In the Risk360 Admin Portal, under the **Administration **pages, the data is organized and displayed in tables. You can modify the default settings for each table. Every time you make a change, the settings are stored in your browser's local storage so that your changes are preserved the next time you log in.
If you clear your cache or use a different browser, your settings are lost.
You can do the following:
- [Reorder columns](#reorder)
- [Resize columns](#resize)
- [Hide columns](#hide)
- [Sort the column data](#sort)
- [Reset table to default settings](#reset)
[]You can reorder columns in one of 2 ways:
- [From the Table](#from-table)
- [From the Column Menu settings](#from-column-menu-settings)
[]When you hover over a column header in the table, a **Move** cursor appears. To reorder, drag and drop the column to the desired location. An arrow indicates where the column ends up after the drop.
After you have dragged the column to the desired location, the table refreshes and displays data in the new column order.
The column menu settings also change to reflect the new order.

[]When you hover over a listed column name in the settings, a **Move** cursor appears. Drag and drop the column to the desired position. After you drop the column name, the table refreshes and displays the data in the new column order.

[]When the data in a column takes up more space than the viewing area allows, it is truncated. You can view the truncated data in the tooltip. You can also increase the column width.
To increase the column width, hover over the right border of the column. A **Resize** icon appears. Drag and drop to the desired column width.

[]When you do not need to view all the columns at the same time, you can hide them so only the columns you want to view are visible.
To hide a column, hover over the **Column Menu** icon on the top right of the table and uncheck the column names you wish to hide. After you click on the checkbox, the table refreshes and displays only the checked columns.
For tables under **Administration **pages, you must have at least one column visible at all times.

[]When you hover over different column headers, you can see that some columns have an arrow icon next to them. These arrows indicate that you can sort the data in those columns. You can sort data in ascending or descending order.
To sort a column, click on the arrow in the table column header.

[]When you make changes to the columns, you can revert back to the default settings by hovering over the **Column Menu** and clicking the **Reset** icon.
This doesn't reset your sort order.
