You can print any [standard](/zia/about-interactive-reports) or [custom](/zia/creating-copying-report) report. The service provides a Print View mode where you can view a report and then print it. Some settings, such as the ability to print to PDF, depend on your OS and browser. For example, Google Chrome and Apple Mac devices provide PDF support.
To print a report:
- Go to **Analytics **>** Interactive Reports**.
- Select a report from the **Standard Reports** or **Custom Reports** tab.
- Click the **Print View **icon.
The service displays the report in Print View. You can page through the report to check it and either click **Go Back** to edit the report before you print it or click **Print**.
