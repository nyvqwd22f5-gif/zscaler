To download a CSV file of groups and their information:
- Navigate to **Administration** > **User Management**.
- Click the** Groups **tab.
- Click **Download**.
This CSV file can't be used to [import groups](/zia/importing-group-information-csv-file) because it uses a different format. If you need to import a CSV file to make modifications to groups, use the same format as the **Sample Import CSV file** provided by Zscaler.
