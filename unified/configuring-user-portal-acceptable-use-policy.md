You can create an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that your users must accept before they can connect to a [user portal](/unified/policies/private-applications/access-control/clientless/user-portal).
An AUP provides the following benefits and enable you to:
- Connect to a user portal to provide visibility to authorized applications for your organization’s employees and partners.
- Create a User Portal AUP.
To configure a User Portal AUP:
- Go to **Resource Management** > **User Portal** > **User Portal AUP**.
- On the **Acceptable Use Policy** page:
- **Frequency**: Select how often the user portal will display the AUP (i.e., **Once** or **Never**).
- **Display Text**: Enter or copy and paste your organization's AUP into the field. Only plain text is supported.
- Under **Support Information**, enter the **Email **and **Phone Number** for your organization's support team.
- (Optional) Click **Preview **to view the AUP as users will see it when they initially access a user portal.
