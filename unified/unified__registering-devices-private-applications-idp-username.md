You can register a device in the Admin Portal with the username entered for Private Applications authentication instead of the username that is used for enrollment in the Zscaler Client Connector app.
To register a device with the Private Applications IdP username:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure > Connectors > Client > App Supportability**.
- On the **App Supportability** tab, select the **Register device with ZPA IdP Username** switch.
