Disaster recovery application segments are application segments designated as available for disaster recovery. Application segments that are designated for disaster recovery ensure business continuity in the scenario of a disaster event. To learn more, see [Understanding Disaster Recovery](/unified/understanding-disaster-recovery) and [Configuring Application Segments](/unified/configuring-defined-application-segments).
Disaster recovery application segments provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster scenario that impacts the global Zscaler cloud infrastructure.
- Provide users with access to critical applications during a disaster scenario.
