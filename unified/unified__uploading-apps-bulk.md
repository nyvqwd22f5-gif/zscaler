If you have multiple apps to manually add to the App Inventory, you can save time by uploading them in bulk using their client IDs.
To upload apps in bulk:
- In the left-side navigation, go to** Inventory**.
-
Click the **Upload Apps** icon in the upper-right corner.
[See image.](#apptotal-upload-apps-button)
The **Upload Applications** window appears.
-
In the **Upload Applications** window, enter the client IDs you want to add, separated by commas.
[See image.](#apptotal-upload-apps-client-ids)
You can use any delimiter, not just a comma (`,)`.
-
Click **Upload**.
A summary appears. Apps in **Pending** mode are submitted for sandboxing. After some time, you receive an email when they are uploaded.

You can also manually upload apps from 3rd-Party App Governance's App Catalog to your inventory. To learn more, see [Searching for Apps](/unified/searching-apps).
