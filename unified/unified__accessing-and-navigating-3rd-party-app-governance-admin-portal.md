Zscaler 3rd-Party App Governance allows you to discover, manage, reduce, and control the attack surface introduced by third-party apps, extensions, and add-ons to corporate SaaS applications. With 3rd-Party App Governance, you can uncover and maintain an up-to-date app inventory, gaining full visibility into what is connected, the risks posed, and how each app is used in your environment.

Authentication is performed using Google, Azure AD federation, or Okta. Passwords are not supported. SAML federation with your own identity provider (IdP) (e.g., Okta) is supported on enterprise tiers.
On the first sign-in, an empty dashboard appears, as 3rd-Party App Governance is not yet connected to any of your platforms. You must navigate to the **Integrations **window from the left-side navigation or click **Add Integration** in the upper-left corner of the dashboard to connect 3rd-Party App Governance to your platform. To learn more, see [Connecting Your Platforms to 3rd-Party App Governance](/unified/connecting-your-platforms-3rd-party-app-governance). You can choose between self-onboarding or scheduling a concierge onboarding with Zscaler Support.
A user with admin privileges is required to connect to your platforms. This can be done with any user, not necessarily the user you used to sign in to 3rd-Party App Governance (some clients use dedicated service accounts).
