Amazon Web Services (AWS) account groups enable Zscaler Cloud Connector to be aware of other accounts it can get the workload tags from. Therefore, the Cloud Connector is not tied to the account where it is deployed.
AWS account groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Tie the Cloud Connector to a list of accounts.
- Enable Cloud Connector to learn workload tags from multiple accounts.
- Simplify deployment with a centralized model that links all accounts to a single Cloud Connector group.
