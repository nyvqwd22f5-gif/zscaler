You can configure Zscaler Client Connector to collect geolocation information from devices enabled with Digital Experience Monitoring. This setting works in conjunction with the Digital Experience Monitoring settings in [Zscaler Service Entitlement](/unified/about-zscaler-service-entitlement), and is enabled by default.
You can access this feature only if Digital Experience Monitoring has been enabled for the company or for select groups in **Zscaler Service Entitlement**.
To configure whether Zscaler Client Connector can collect Digital Experience Monitoring geolocation information:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure > Connectors > Client > User Privacy**.
- In the **User Privacy** tab, enable or disable the **Collect Location Info for ZDX** setting.
