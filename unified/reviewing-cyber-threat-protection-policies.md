Cyber threat protection policies protect your users from a variety of security threats. Zscaler offers the following types of cyberthreat protection:
- **Isolation**: uses browser isolation to open suspicious URLs which have not yet been categorized in a remote browser in a Zscaler data center. These include newly registered URLs, dormant URLs, as well as URLs which have not yet been observed and categorized by Zscaler.
- **Botnet Protection**: protects your users from botnets with a series of methods including blocking known command and control (C2) servers, blocking domain generation algorithms, and examining potential botnet traffic.
- **Phishing & Fraud Protection**: blocks known and suspected phishing sites, and blocks adware, spyware, web spam, and cryptomining to protect your users from fraud.
- **Malicious Active Content Prevention**: blocks a number of vulnerabilities that may cause users to download malware, including websites that attempt to load dangerous content, exploitable file formats, and web browser vulnerabilities.
- **P2P Protection**: blocks the use of peer-to-peer filing sharing applications, many of which encrypt content so they cannot be inspected for data leakage.
- **Malware Protection**: blocks malware by inspecting inbound and outbound traffic, HTTP, FTP, and FTP over HTTP using signature-based detection and protection using malware feeds from trusted industry partners.
- **Zero-Day Attack Protection**: isolates and analyzes zero-day threats in a sandbox environment.
During onboarding, Zscaler sets up its default cyber threat protection policies. You can fine-tune these policies later in the Admin Portal. To learn more, see [Configuring the Advanced Threat Protection Policy](/unified/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy).
