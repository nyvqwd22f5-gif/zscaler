You can configure up to 16 Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) feeds to specify the data from the tunnel logs that the NSS sends to the security information and event management (SIEM) system.
You can select multiple tunnel log record types (e.g., IKE Phase 2, Sample, etc.) to send in a single NSS feed. You can configure common filters that apply to all record types based on locations, VPN credentials, and source and destination IP addresses.
Before configuring an NSS feed for tunnel logs, consider the [General Guidelines for NSS Feeds and Feed Formats](/unified/general-guidelines-nss-feeds-and-feed-formats).
To configure an NSS feed for tunnel logs:
- Go to **Logs **>** Log Streaming **>** Nanolog Streaming Service**.
-
From the **NSS Feeds** tab, click **Add NSS Feed**.
The **Add NSS Feed** window appears.
- In the **Add NSS Feed** window:
- **Feed Name**: Enter or edit the name of the feed. Each feed is a connection between the NSS and your SIEM.
- **NSS Type**: **NSS for Web** is selected by default.
- **NSS Server**:** **Select an NSS server from the list. A [configured NSS server](/unified/adding-nss-servers) is required to add an NSS feed.
- **Status**:** **The NSS feed is **Enabled** by default. Choose **Disabled** if you want to activate it at a later time.
- **SIEM Destination Type**: Select the type of destination:
- **SIEM IP Address**:** **Enter the IP address of the SIEM to which the logs are streamed.
- **SIEM FQDN**: Enter the destination for the TCP connection to which the logs are streamed. This allows failover from one IP to the other without manual intervention, but rather relying on updating the DNS entry. The NSS re-resolves the FQDN only when the existing connection goes down. This feature cannot be used for DNS-based load balancing.
- **SIEM TCP Port**: Enter the port number of the SIEM to which the logs are streamed. Ensure that the SIEM is configured to accept the feed from the NSS.
- **SIEM Rate**: Leave as **Unlimited**, unless you need to throttle the output stream due to licensing or other constraints.
- **SIEM Rate Limit (Events per Second)**: This is only applicable if you selected **Limited** under SIEM Rate. Enter an appropriate rate limit for the events per second that you want streamed to your SIEM. This number must be between 100 and 1,000,000. A limit that is too low for the traffic volume causes log loss.
- **Log Type**:** **Choose **Tunnel**.
- **Record Type**: Specify the tunnel log record types to send in the single NSS feed:
- **IKE Phase 1**: Details for IPSec Phase 1 negotiation (applies to IPSec only)
- **IKE Phase 2**: Details for IPSec Phase 2 negotiation (applies to IPSec only)
- **Sample**: Statistics collected in 60-second sample windows (applies to both GRE and IPSec)
- **Tunnel Event**: Status change events (applies to both GRE and IPSec)
- **Feed Output Type**:** **The output is a comma-separated (**CSV**) list by default. Choose **Tab-separated **to create a tab-separated list. Choose **Custom **to use a different delimiter, such as a dash, and enter the delimiter when you specify the feed output format. This menu also lists feed output types for specific SIEMs.
- **Time Zone**:** **By default, this is set to the organization's time zone. The time zone you set applies to the time field in the output file. The time zone automatically adjusts to changes in daylight savings in the specific time zone. The configured time zone can be output to the logs as a separate field. The list of time zones is derived from the IANA Time Zone database. Direct GMT offsets can also be specified.
- **Duplicate Logs**: To ensure that no logs are skipped during downtime, specify the number of minutes that the NSS sends duplicate logs. Zscaler recommends setting the number to 5 minutes, or more if required. This allows the NSS to send up to 60 minutes (one hour) of logs to the SIEM after the connection is restored. To learn more, see [General Guidelines for NSS Feeds and Feed Formats](/unified/general-guidelines-nss-feeds-and-feed-formats#duplicate-logs-example).
- **Feed Output Format**:** **These are the fields that are displayed in the output. You can edit the default list, and if you choose **Custom **as the **Feed Output Type**, change the delimiter as well. See [NSS Feed Output Format: Tunnel Logs](/unified/nss-feed-output-format-tunnel-logs) for information about the available fields and their syntax.
- Define the filters:
- **Tunnel Type**: You can limit the logs based on the tunnel types:
- **Extranet**: IPSec tunnels that connect a business partner’s data center to the Zscaler service. The partner (i.e., Extranet Resource) establishes the connection to Zscaler. To learn more, see [About Extranet](/unified/about-extranet).
- **GRE**: Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnels.
- **IPSec IKEv1**: IPSec tunnels that use the Internet Key Exchange Version 1 negotiation process.
- **IPSec IKEv2**: IPSec tunnels that use the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 negotiation process.
- **Z-Tunnel 2.0**: Tunnel that uses DTLS, TLS, or UDP to send packets to the Zscaler service. Note that only Zscaler Cloud Connector supports UDP.
- **Location**:** **Use this filter to limit the logs to specific locations from which transactions were generated. You can search for locations. There is no limit on the number of locations that you can select. Locations that are deleted after they are selected appear with a strikethrough line.
- **VPN Credentials**:** **For IPSec tunnels, you can limit the logs to specific tunnel VPN credentials. You can search for VPN credentials. There is no limit to the number of VPN credentials that you can select. VPN credentials that are deleted after they are selected appear with a strikethrough line.
-
**Source IPs**:** **You can limit the logs based on the tunnel's source IP address. You can enter:
- An IP address (e.g., 198.51.100.100)
- A range of IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.10)
- An IP address with a netmask (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24)
You can enter multiple entries. Press `Enter` after each entry, then click **Add Items**. For item lists, you can view up to 500 items on a page; filter the list by searching for a word, phrase, or number contained in an item; and remove all items from the list (**Remove All**) or only items from a specific page (**Remove Page**). If you select **Remove All** or **Remove Page**, a confirmation window appears.
-
**Destination VIPs**:** **You can limit the logs based on the tunnel's destination VIP address. You can enter:
- An IP address (e.g., 198.51.100.100)
- A range of IP addresses (e.g., 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.10)
- An IP address with a netmask (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24)
You can enter multiple entries. Press `Enter` after each entry, then click **Add Items**. For item lists, you can view up to 500 items on a page; filter the list by searching for a word, phrase, or number contained in an item; and remove all items from the list (**Remove All**) or only items from a specific page (**Remove Page**). If you select **Remove All** or **Remove Page**, a confirmation window appears.
-
**Tunnel Source Port**:** **You can limit the logs based on the tunnel's source ports. You can specify individual ports or a range of ports (e.g., 1–65535).
You can enter multiple entries. Press `Enter` after each entry, then click **Add Items**. For item lists, you can view up to 500 items on a page; filter the list by searching for a word, phrase, or number contained in an item; and remove all items from the list (**Remove All**) or only items from a specific page (**Remove Page**). If you select **Remove All** or **Remove Page**, a confirmation window appears.
