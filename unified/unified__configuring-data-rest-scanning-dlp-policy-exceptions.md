Optionally, you can configure [SaaS Security Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/unified/about-data-rest-scanning-dlp) policy exceptions for sanctioned SaaS applications.
For example, you can create an exception for your organization’s CEO if you don’t want to inspect the emails your CEO sends. If your organization has a security research group maintaining a malicious files repository that must be exempt from inspection, you can also create an exception for the group.
