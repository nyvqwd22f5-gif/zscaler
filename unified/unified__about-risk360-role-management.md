The roles that are assigned to admins dictate the level of access they have to the Risk360 features in the Experience Center. Zscaler provides a default super admin role that has full access to the Risk360. This role is assigned to the default admin, but you can assign this role to other admins as necessary.
Roles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure admins for Risk360 features based on their role.
- Assign roles to admins to maintain hierarchy among the admins so that the admin can't modify the settings of an admin with a broader scope.
- View all the configured admins, their access levels, and other information.
