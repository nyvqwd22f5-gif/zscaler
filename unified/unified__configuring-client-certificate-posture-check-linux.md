This article describes how to configure the Client Certificate for Linux. You must perform these steps to successfully use the Client Certificate posture check for Linux in the Admin Portal.
The Client Certificate posture check verifies the following conditions:
- The certificate authority (CA) certificate uploaded to the Admin Portal can be trusted by the Linux client system.
- The Client Certificate on the Linux client system is either issued by the CA certificate or is on the certificate chain of trust, with the uploaded CA certificate being a root CA.
- The private key associated with the Client Certificate is on the Linux client system.
The Client Certificate posture check does not perform a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) check.
Follow these steps to configure the Client Certificate for Linux:
- On the Linux client system, install Zscaler Client Connector.
- In the Admin Portal, upload a CA certificate issued by an internal root CA trusted by the organization’s users. You can upload one of the following certificates:
- A root CA certificate (a self-signed certificate). This root CA certificate and all intermediate CAs must be installed in the trusted certificate store on the Linux client system [following these sample steps.](#self-signed-certificate)
[]
- Create the CA key: `openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096`
- Create the self-signed root certificate for signing client certificates: `openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt`
- Create the private key: `openssl genrsa -out client.key 1024`
- Create the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the client key: `openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr`
- Sign the client certificate with the root certificate: `openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out client_cert.pem`
- Upload the root certificate `ca.crt` to the Admin Portal.
- Install the root certificate `ca.crt` to the client machine using the following commands:
- On Ubuntu systems:
sudo cp ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
- On CentOS/Fedora systems:
sudo update-ca-trust force-enable
sudo cp ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust extract
-
Copy the Client Certificate file `client_cert.pem` to the following locations on the Linux client:
The certificate file must be Base-64 encoded and the file name must end with the extension .pem.
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is disabled, copy to `~/.Zscaler/certificates/`. The Client Certificate file has user access permission.
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is enabled, copy to `/opt/zscaler/client_cert/`. The Client Certificate file has root access only.
- Confirm that certificates are properly installed by running the following commands:
- On Ubuntu systems: `openssl verify -show_chain -CApath /etc/ssl/certs/ <client_cert_file>`
- On CentOS/Fedora systems: `openssl verify -show_chain -CApath /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/ <client_cert_file>`
- An intermediate certificate. If there are intermediate CAs on the certificate chain of trust, they must be installed either in the system store or the directory `/opt/zscaler/intermediate_ca/`.
- Copy the Client Certificate file `client_cert.pem` to the following locations on the Linux client:
The certificate file must be Base-64 encoded and the file name must end with the extension .pem.
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is disabled, copy to `~/.Zscaler/certificates/`. The Client Certificate file has user access permission.
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is enabled, copy to `/opt/zscaler/client_cert/`. The Client Certificate file has root access only.
Confirm that certificates are properly installed by running the following commands:
- On Ubuntu systems: `openssl verify -show_chain -CApath/etc/ssl/certs/ <client_cert_file>`
- On CentOS/Fedora systems: `openssl verify -show_chain -CApath /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/ <client_cert_file>`
- Copy the private key that is associated with the Client Certificate to the Linux client system. The private key store location depends on whether or not **Non-Exportable Private Key** is enabled or disabled:
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is disabled, copy the private key in the user's home directory: `~/.Zscaler/certificates/private/`
- If **Non-Exportable Private Key** is enabled, copy the private key to the directory: `/opt/zscaler/private_key/`. This directory is created when you install Zscaler Client Connector. This directory is owned by the root and has a permission setting of 755. Zscaler Client Connector checks the private key file's permission. Posture validation fails if the file can be accessed by non-root users.
The private key file should be Base-64 encoded and the file name must end with the extension `.`key.
- Log in to Zscaler Client Connector.
