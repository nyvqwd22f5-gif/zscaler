This article describes how to create user groups on the [User Groups](/unified/about-user-groups) page. You can use a [CSV file to add multiple group](/unified/importing-user-group-details-csv-file)s at once. Before you create a user group, ensure that you have added the users that you want to include in a group, or you can also assign a group to the user when configuring a user. To configure users, see [Adding Users](/unified/adding-users-0).
To add a new group:
- Go to **Administration **> **Identity **> **ZIdentity **> **User Groups**.
- Click **Add Group**.
The **Add Group** window appears.
- In the **Add Group **window:
- **User Group**: Enter a group name. The name can contain up to 128 characters.
- **Assign Users**: Assign users to the group. Click the checkbox against the username to add them to the group. Click **X **to remove a user or **Clear All **at any time**.**
- **Description**: Optionally, enter additional notes or information. The content cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
