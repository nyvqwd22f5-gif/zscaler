To expedite the process of combining application segment data, you can merge imported application segments. Merging imported application segments allows you to quickly group together application information that you want to organize depending on the different application data. To learn more, see [Using Application Segment Import](/unified/using-application-segment-import).
To merge imported application segments:
- Go to **Policies **> **Access Control** > **Private Applications **> **App Segments**.
- Click **Application Segment Import**.
- Select at least two or more application segments from the table.
- From the **Actions** drop-down menu, select **Merge Application Segments**.
- Select the **Defined Application Segment** and **Port Type** from each drop-down menu. Click **Apply**.
