Default isolation profiles are automatically created for any organization using Isolation. This allows a quick setup for your organization without manually creating the first isolation profile needed for configuring browser isolation. It is not required to use the default isolation profiles for any configuration. They are only used if your organization does not manually create any isolation profiles.
