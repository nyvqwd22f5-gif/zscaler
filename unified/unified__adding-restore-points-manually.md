You can back up and restore a set of policies and configuration settings, and save up to 12 restore points. To learn more, see [About Backup and Restore](/unified/about-backup-and-restore).
To add a restore point:
- Go to **Administration **> **Backup & Restore **> **Internet & SaaS Applications**.
-
Click **Add Restore Point**.
The **Add Restore Point** window appears.
- In the **Add Restore Point** window:
- **Restore Point Name**:** **Enter a name to identify the restore point.
-
**Golden Restore Point**: Enable this option if you want to set the restore point as the golden restore point.
There can be only one golden restore point at any given point in time, and you cannot delete it.
- **Description**:** **(Optional) Enter additional notes or information.
- Click **Save** and activate the change.
If the number of restore points reaches a limit of 12, you cannot add a new restore point manually without deleting an existing one.
