The risk score represents the risk an app poses to your environment. It is automatically calculated by the system based on the compounded risk the app poses, app attributes, findings, and blast radius. You can view and change the risk score for an app in the [App Inventory](/unified/about-app-inventory) or the [App Panel ](/unified/about-app-panel)header. You can also influence the risk score by dismissing or resolving findings. To learn more, see [Updating the App Finding Status](/unified/updating-app-finding-status).
