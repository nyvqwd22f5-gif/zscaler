Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and organizations must ensure that access to sensitive applications is dynamically managed based on real-time context and risk signals.
Zscaler offers continuous adaptive access to monitor users, devices, and security context to enforce adaptive access control at policy enforcement points in Internet & SaaS (Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA)) and Private Applications (Zscaler Private Access (ZPA)). The Zscaler Adaptive Access Engine ingests security signals and distributes [adaptive access profiles](/unified/about-adaptive-access-profiles) in real time to policy decision points, so security policies can be evaluated and adapted based on the nature of the identities, their profiles, and the applications being accessed. The Adaptive Access Engine provides a unified way to analyze and interpret events in a specific context to derive insightful results. These events might occur inside or outside the Zscaler ecosystem.
Adaptive Access Engine includes the following key features and benefits:
- **Real-Time Risk Mitigation**: Leverage real-time signals from Zscaler and third-party security systems, to dynamically adjust user access, thereby immediately closing the window of opportunity for malicious actors.
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Integrate diverse signals (user risk profiles, device postures, behavioral analytics) into access decisions to ensure a robust security framework.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated policy adjustments based on real-time data, reducing the need for manual intervention, administrative overhead, and the potential for human error.
- **User Experience**: Improve overall user experience with conditional access based on real-time evaluations that prevent unnecessary access denials.
