An [Adaptive Access profile](/unified/understanding-adaptive-access-engine) identifies user and device subjects with a set of conditions that combine context signals published by Zscaler and third-party sources using logical operators. These criteria include user and device context. The Adaptive Access profiles are made available to Internet & SaaS (Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA)) and Private Applications (Zscaler Private Access (ZPA)) that enforce policies to control user and device access to applications via Zscaler.
Adaptive Access profiles include the following benefits and enable you to:
- Define profiles based on user and device context signals and enforce security policies to control access to sensitive applications.
- Identify common context patterns and define new profiles.
- Review the existing Adaptive Access profiles and determine their effectiveness.
