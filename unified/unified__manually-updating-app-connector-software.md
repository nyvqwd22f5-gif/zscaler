Once an App Connector is scheduled for an update, you can't [change the periodic software update time](/unified/scheduling-periodic-software-updates-app-connector-group) for that particular App Connector. However, you can update the App Connector's software manually.
To manually update software for an App Connector:
- Go to the **App Connectors **page (Infrastructure > Private Applications > Components > App Connectors).
- In the table, locate the App Connector you want to update.
- In the **Update Status** column, verify that the status is **Scheduled**. If the status is not **Scheduled**, then you can't manually update the App Connector.
- Click the **Update Now** icon.
