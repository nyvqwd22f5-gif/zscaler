You can add users to ZIdentity by creating them [locally within the Admin Portal](/unified/adding-users-0) or via an [external identity provider (IdP) provider](/unified/about-external-identity-providers). In addition, you can assign them [admin entitlements](/unified/about-administrative-entitlements) to make them administrators for a Zscaler service, such as Internet & SaaS, Private Applications, or Digital Experience Monitoring, or you can assign them [service entitlements](/unified/about-service-entitlements) so they are able to authenticate to a Zscaler service (e.g., Internet & SaaS, Private Applications, or Digital Experience Monitoring) as an end user.
Managing users provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Control which users within your organization are service admins or assigned to a Zscaler service.
- Assign users to a single or multiple Zscaler services.
- Assign users with administrator roles to manage specific Zscaler services.
- Manage all users in ZIdentity instead of maintaining individual user databases in each of the subscribed Zscaler service.
