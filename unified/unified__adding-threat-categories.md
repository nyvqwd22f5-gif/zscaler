Threat categories group common threats (e.g., viruses, botnets, exploits) together, which can be detected and controlled by Zscaler's signature-based intrusion detection. In addition to the predefined threat categories provided by Zscaler, you can define custom [threat categories](/unified/about-threat-categories) and add [custom IPS signature rules](/zia/about-custom-ips-signature-rules) to them.
To add a custom threat category,
- Go to **Policies **>** Cybersecurity** > **Inline Security** > **Custom IPS Signatures**.
- Click the **Threat Categories** tab.
-
Click** Add Threat Category**.
The** Add Threat Category** window appears.
- In the **Add Threat Category **window:
- **Name**: Provide a unique name for the threat category. The name can contain any characters, including spaces, within a character limit of 255.
- **Description**: (Optional) Provide a description for the threat category. The description cannot exceed 255 characters.
- Click **Save **and activate the change.
