To download a CSV file of departments and their information:
- []Navigate to **Administration** > **Identity** > **Internet & SaaS** > **User Management**.
- Click the** Departments **tab.
- Click **Download**.
This CSV file can't be used to [import departments](/zslogin/adding-departments) because it uses a different format. If you need to import a CSV file to make modifications to departments, use the same format as the **Download** **Sample **file provided by Zscaler.
