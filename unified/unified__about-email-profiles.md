Email profiles let you create and manage domain and recipient email profiles that can be used as part of Zscaler's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to detect and take action on sensitive data across multiple channels. To learn more, see [About Data Loss Prevention](/unified/about-data-loss-prevention), [About SaaS Security API DLP](/unified/about-saas-security-api-dlp), and [About Outbound Email Policy](/unified/about-outbound-email-policy).
Email profiles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage personal email and organizational domains that you want to include or exclude from DLP policy rules across channels.
- Manage individual users and groups that you want to include or exclude from outbound email policy rules.
- Easily edit domain and recipient profiles to update all policy rules where the profiles are used.
