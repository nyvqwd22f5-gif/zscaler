You must place each application segment that you configure into a segment group. This allows you to configure access policies based on segment groups.
Segment groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Logically group application segments together for easier management.
- Provide a layer of abstraction to simplify access policy configuration.
About the Segment Groups Page
On the Segment Groups page (Resource Management > Application Management > Segment Groups), you can do the following:
-
Expand one or all rows in the table to see more information about each segment group.
If there are required fields missing, the **Incomplete Configuration** icon (![ZSDK-SegmentGroup-incompleteicon.png](/downloads/zsdk/application-management/managing-segment-groups/ZSDK-SegmentGroup-incompleteicon.png)
) appears next to the indicated item.
- [Add a new segment group](/zsdk/managing-segment-groups).
- Filter the information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied.
- View a list of all segment groups configured for your organization. For each segment group, you can see:
- **Name**: The segment group name.
- **Status**: Whether the segment group is enabled or disabled.
- **Actions**: The available actions you can take for the segment group.
