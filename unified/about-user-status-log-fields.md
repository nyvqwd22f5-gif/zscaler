The Log Streaming Service can send User Status log information to any third-party log analytics tool. By default, the User Status log type includes the fields listed in the following table for each log template (i.e., CSV, JSON, TSV). While configuring your log receiver, you can edit the default log stream content to capture only specific fields, and create a Custom log template.
