Zscaler's email tenants feature allows you to create email tenants that you can easily add to Zscaler Outbound Email Policy rules to monitor and take action on sensitive data sent by members of your organization to external domains. To learn more, see [About Outbound Email Policy](/unified/about-outbound-email-policy).
Email tenants provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage email tenants that you want to include in, or exclude from, outbound email policy rules.
- Edit tenants quickly from the profile, which carries over to every setting using that email tenant.
