After you [create a user portal](/unified/configuring-user-portals) for your organization, you can [add links to any applications](/unified/about-user-portal-links) that your employees and partners are authorized to access. If the application requires that Zscaler Client Connector is installed on the user's device, you can provide links within the user portal to allow them to download the proper Zscaler Client Connector installer for their operating system (OS).
The **Client Connector Download Links** page allows you to add a download link to the proper installer for the following PC and mobile OSs:
- Apple iOS
- Apple macOS
- Google Android
- Linux
- Microsoft Windows
You must determine which versions of the Zscaler Client Connector installer are approved for your organization. You are also responsible for maintaining these Zscaler Client Connector download links on the portal as newer versions become available.
To add or update a Zscaler Client Connector download link:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Policies** > **Access Control **> **Clientless** > **Client Connector Download Links**.
