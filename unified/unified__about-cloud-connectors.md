Cloud Connectors are virtual machines (VMs) that simplify traffic forwarding to Zscaler services. The Cloud Connector also secures server access to the internet and provides direct connectivity to the Zscaler cloud, providing apps with highly secure and simplified access to the internet.
Cloud Connectors provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Extend the capabilities of Internet & SaaS and Private Applications to cloud-native workloads, enabling enterprises to secure cloud workload communications over any network.
- Simplify multi-cloud networking by eliminating complex routing, virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewalls while allowing for flexible forwarding and simple policy management.
- Secure workload traffic to the internet and provide seamless connectivity to private applications in other cloud regions or data centers.
Cloud Connectors listed in the Admin Portal come from the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. You can create and update Cloud Connectors in the Cloud Connector Portal.
