When a user in your organization enters an isolated session, an end user notification appears to notify them they are entering isolation. This end user notification can be customized to align with an organization's look and feel.
Admins can choose an end user notification from the available banner themes when [creating](/unified/creating-isolation-profiles-internet-saas) or [editing an isolation profile](/unified/editing-your-isolation-profile-internet-saas). They can also [add](/unified/adding-banner-theme-isolation-end-user-notification-internet-saas) and edit banner themes. The Default banner theme is automatically applied to all the isolation profiles in your organization, unless you edit a specific profile to have a different banner theme. You cannot delete the Default banner theme, but you can edit it.
To edit a banner theme:
- Go **Policies **> **Common Configuration** > **Resources **> **Browser Isolation**.
- Click **Isolation Banner**.
- Click the **Edit** icon for the banner. The **Edit Isolation Banner **window appears.

- Click **Save**.
