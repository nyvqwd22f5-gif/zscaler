The Zscaler service provides real-time log consolidation across the globe, so you can view every transaction performed by your users regardless of where they are in the world.
Logs are stored for 180 days in the Zscaler Nanolog servers. Zscaler also offers the Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS), a virtual machine (VM) that can stream web traffic logs in real time from the Zscaler Nanolog to your security information and event management (SIEM) system, such as Splunk, enabling real-time alerting, correlation with the logs of your firewall and other devices, and long-term local log archival. Contact your Zscaler representative or Zscaler Support for more information on subscribing to NSS.
The Insights Logs pages provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View logs for each transaction processed by Zscaler.
- Quickly access the desired logs with the help of multiple filters and operators when troubleshooting.
You can view the following logs pages:
- Session Logs
- DNS Logs
