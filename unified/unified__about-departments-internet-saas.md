Departments are used in policies and reports, so consider your reporting needs when defining departments in the Zscaler service. Ensure that the departments are structured according to your reporting needs so that you get the desired department-based reports.
Unlike groups, a user can belong to only one department. The service tracks usage at the user level. If a user belonged to multiple departments, then they would be reported multiple times. Additionally, with the role-based admin feature, administrators can have control over a set of users in a department. When you set up administrators, you can define their scope by department. If users belong to more than one department, this can cause conflicts.
Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision [users](/unified/about-users), [groups](/unified/about-groups), and departments as described in [ZIdentity Authentication](/zidentity/authentication). You can also add departments when you configure policies. This article describes how to manage departments on the Departments page as well as provides an overview of its features. You can add up to 140K departments as described in [ZIdentity Departments](/zidentity/administration/departments). For a complete list of ranges and limits per feature, see [Ranges & Limitations](/unified/ranges-limitations#internet-saas).
Departments provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage policies for users based on their departments.
- View department-based reports.
- Categorize users based on departments specific to your organization.
On the Departments page, departments are listed as view-only with limited options (i.e., download department data and search for departments) as you're subscribed to the ZIdentity service. To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
