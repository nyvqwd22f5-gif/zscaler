Uploading your organization's custom SSL certificate is an optional step you can complete when [configuring SSL inspection for Zscaler Client Connector](/unified/configuring-ssl-inspection-zscaler-client-connector).
When you upload your organization’s custom SSL certificate in the Admin Portal, and [turn on the install Zscaler SSL Certificate option](/unified/configuring-ssl-inspection-zscaler-client-connector), the custom certificate is automatically installed on users’ devices.
The **Install Zscaler SSL Certificate** feature is not supported on devices running macOS Big Sur (11) and later.
To upload the custom certificate:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure > Connectors > Client > Directory Sync & Custom Root Cert**.
- Under **Custom Certificate**, click **Upload**.
