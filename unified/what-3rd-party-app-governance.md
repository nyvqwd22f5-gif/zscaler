Zscaler 3rd-Party App Governance allows you to discover, manage, reduce, and control the attack surface introduced by third-party apps, extensions, and add-ons to corporate SaaS applications.
With 3rd-Party App Governance, you can uncover and maintain an up-to-date app inventory, gaining full visibility into what is connected, the risks posed, and how each app is used in your environment.
You can effectively govern your environment by classifying apps as sanctioned or unsanctioned; monitoring and receiving alerts on drift in app usage or security posture; and receiving notifications when apps are introduced in violation of corporate policy or compliance.
You can manually or automatically streamline remediation actions such as banning or revoking an app token, and involve end users in the review process. 3rd-Party App Governance lets you reduce your vetting or pre-vetting procedures from hours to minutes with a centralized console and extensive app catalog that unifies key attributes and automates the majority of the process.
