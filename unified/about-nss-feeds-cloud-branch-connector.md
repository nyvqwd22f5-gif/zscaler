A Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) feed specifies the data from the logs that the NSS sends to the security information and event management (SIEM) system.
You can add up to 16 NSS feeds for each NSS. ([Session Logs](/unified/adding-nss-feeds-session-logs) are limited to 8 feeds per NSS to ensure optimal performance.)
NSS Feeds provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Apply different fields, formats, and filters for each feed.
- Filter the data, to send only the data you need to the SIEM.
