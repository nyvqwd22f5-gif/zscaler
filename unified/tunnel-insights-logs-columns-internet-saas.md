- PSK
- DSS Signature
- RSA Signature
- RSA Encryption
- RSA Rev
- **Cipher Protocol**: The cipher protocol used by the tunnel (i.e., TLS or DTLS).
- **Cipher**: The ciphers used for the control and data channel of the tunnel.
- **Cloud Connector Instance**: The specific Zscaler software instance from which you want to view the tunnel logs.
- **Data Center**: The data center associated with the tunnel.
- **Encryption Algorithm**: The encryption algorithm used to encrypt handshakes (IPSec Phase 1) and data (IPSec Phase 2). The following algorithms appear under this column:
- DES-IV64
- DES

- RC4
- NULL
- AES
- Twofish
- **Event Time**: The date and time the event occurred.
- **Extranet Name**: The extranet name configured for your organization.
- **Event Reason**: The reason that the status change occurred for a tunnel. The following reasons appear under this column:
- Lifetime expired
- PSK not found
- PSK mismatch
- Invalid proposal
- DPD timeout
- Timeout
- Org excluded from DC
- **IKE Phase 2 SPI**: The Security Parameter Index (SPI) for the IKE SA established in Phase 2.
- **Initiator Cookie**: The initiator's cookie value used during the IPSec IKE Phase 1 message exchange.
- **IPSec Protocol**: Protocols used in establishing the IPSec VPN tunnel.
- None
- AH
- ESP
- ISAKMP
- IPComp
- **Keep-Alive Packets**: The Keep-Alive packet ensures that the SSL VPN connection remains open even when the device is inactive.
- **Location**: The [location](/unified/about-locations) associated with the tunnel.
- **Life Bytes**: The total number of life bytes that is transmitted over an IPSec SA before it expires.
- **Logged Time**: The date and time the event was logged.
- **Log Type**: The type of tunnel logs. The following types appear under this column:
- **Sample**: Logs regarding data activity through the tunnel. Applies to both GRE and IPSec.
- **IPSec Phase 1**: Logs containing details for IPSec Phase 1 negotiation. Applies to IPSec only.
- **IPSec Phase 2**: Logs containing details for IPSec Phase 2 negotiation. Applies to IPSec only.
- **Tunnel Event**: Logs indicating status changes or failure events. Applies to both GRE and IPSec.
- **Policy Direction**: The direction in which the IPSec Phase 2 policies (allowed subnets/ports/protocols) are proposed. The following directions appear under this column:
- **Inbound**: From the organization's IPSec gateway to Zscaler.
- **Outbound**: From Zscaler to the organization's IPSec gateway.
- **P2 Policy Dest IP - Start**: The start destination IP address specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Dest IP - End**: The end destination IP address specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Src IP - Start**: The start source IP address specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Src IP - End**: The end source IP address specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Src Port - Start**: The start source port number specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Dest Port - End**: The end destination port number specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal.
- **P2 Policy Protocol**: The protocol specified in the IPSec Phase 2 policy proposal. The following protocols appear under this column:
- Any
- TCP
- UDP
- ICMP
- **Received Bytes**: The total bytes of data Zscaler received through the tunnel from the organization in the one-minute sample interval.
- **Received Packets**: The total number of packets Zscaler received through the tunnel from the organization in the one-minute sample interval.
- **Responder Cookie**: The responder's cookie value used during the IPSec IKE Phase 1 message exchange.
- **Sent Bytes**: The total bytes of data Zscaler sent through the tunnel to the organization in the one-minute sample interval.
- **Sent Packets**: The total number of packets Zscaler sent through the tunnel to the organization in the one-minute sample interval.
- **Session ID**: A cryptographically generated random number that is unique per tunnel.
- **Tunnel Destination IP**: The VPN or GRE VIP that the tunnel is destined to.
- **Tunnel Destination Port**: The destination port number of the tunnel.
- **Tunnel Lifetime**: The time after an IKE expires for the IPSec VPN tunnel.
- **Tunnel Source IP**: The source IP address from which the tunnel is initiated.
- **Tunnel Source Port**: The port number from which the tunnel is initiated.
- **Tunnel Status**: The status of the tunnel. The following states appear under this column:
- IPSec tunnel is up
- IPSec tunnel is down
- IPSec tunnel is renegotiated
- Phase 1 is down
- Phase 2 is down
- Error while establishing Phase 1
- Error while establishing Phase 2
- None
The tunnel status **None** indicates that there is no change to the status of the tunnel from the last known status. Any change in the status is indicated by the respective tunnel status value.
- **Tunnel Type**: The type of networking tunnel. The following types appear under this column:
