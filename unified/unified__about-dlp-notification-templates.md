You can create templates for the email notifications that are sent to your organization's auditors when an inline web or a SaaS Security API DLP policy is triggered. When configuring DLP policy rules, you can reference one of the templates you configure here. To learn more, see [Configuring DLP Policy Rules with Content Inspection](/unified/configuring-dlp-policy-rules-content-inspection), [Configuring DLP Policy Rules without Content Inspection](/unified/configuring-dlp-policy-rules-without-content-inspection), and [Configuring the SaaS Security API DLP Policy](/unified/configuring-saas-security-api-dlp-policy).
DLP notification templates provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Specify the information contained in the email notifications that go to your organization's auditors when an inline web or SaaS Security API DLP policy is triggered.
- Associate the notification templates with DLP policy rules.
The notification template macros for the [inline web DLP](/unified/configuring-dlp-notification-templates#web-dlp) and [SaaS Security API DLP](/unified/configuring-dlp-notification-templates#casb-dlp) are different.
