The role admins are assigned dictates the level of access they have to the Admin Portal. Zscaler provides a default super admin role which has full access to the portal. The super admin role is assigned to the default admin, but you can assign this role to other admins as necessary. For each additional role you create, you must define the role's access by specifying permissions.
Role management provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Manage and assign permissions to existing admins.
- Create new, specified admin roles.
