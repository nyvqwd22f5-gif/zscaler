Zscaler recommends deploying Private Service Edges for Private Applications in groups for high availability and horizontal scaling. You can create new Private Service Edge groups for Private Applications whenever you [add a new Private Service Edge for Private Applications](/zpa/configuring-service-edges) using a new provisioning key. Every Private Service Edge belongs to a specific Private Service Edge group.
You do not need to create a new Private Service Edge group every time you add a Private Service Edge. Instead, you can assign the Private Service Edge to a Private Service Edge group that already exists. To learn more, see [Configuring Private Service Edges for Private Applications](/unified/configuring-private-service-edges-private-applications).
Private Service Edge groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Deploy Private Service Edges in your tenant using provisioning keys.
- Group Private Service Edges based on region or functional area (each Private Service Edge must belong to a single group).
- Set the location for the Private Service Edges in the group.
- Configure and enable disaster recovery.
- Set the automated update schedule to an off-hours maintenance window in a region.
- Configure the preferred local version profile for associated Private Service Edges.

- **Client Connector Trusted Networks:** Your organization's [trusted networks](/unified/about-trusted-networks) that are mapped to the Private Service Edge group.
