A posture profile is a set of criteria evaluated on users’ devices that can be used for configuring access Internet & SaaS policies in the Admin Portal. Posture profiles enable admins to apply different policies to users’ personal devices versus their corporate devices. For example, admins might need to grant access to social media sites for users’ personal devices but not for their corporate devices.
Admins can create new device postures or use the existing ones [to determine Internet & SaaS risk levels](/unified/adding-internet-saas-posture-profiles). When you add a posture profile, the devices are given a trust level (High, Medium, Low), which is selected when configuring a [Firewall](/unified/configuring-firewall-policies), [Firewall Filtering](/unified/configuring-firewall-filtering-policy), [URL Filtering](/unified/configuring-url-filtering-policy), [File Type Control](/unified/configuring-file-type-control-policy), [SSL Inspection](/unified/configuring-ssl-inspection-policy), or [Cloud App Control](/unified/adding-rules-cloud-app-control-policy) policy in the Admin Portal.
Internet & SaaS device posture profiles provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Determine access to corporate resources and public applications based on the device posture you set.
- Set up and align posture profiles with trust levels for use in Internet & SaaS policies.
