An NSS feed specifies the data from the logs that the NSS sends to the security information and event management (SIEM). You can filter the data, so you send only the data you need to the SIEM. You can add one or more fields for the logs and one field for alerts. You can add up to 16 NSS feeds for each NSS. [Session Logs](/unified/adding-nss-feeds-session-logs) are limited to 8 feeds per NSS to ensure optimal performance. Each feed can have a different list of fields, a different format, and different filters. To learn more about how to configure each feed, see the following articles:
