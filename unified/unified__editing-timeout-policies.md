To edit a timeout policy rule:
- Go to the **Timeout Policy** page (Policies > Access Control > Private Applications > Timeout Policy).
If you only want to change a timeout policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter in a new value on the [Timeout Policy page](/unified/about-timeout-policy).
- Locate the timeout policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit **icon. You can also edit the [default timeout policy rule](/unified/about-timeout-policy).
- In the **Edit Timeout Policy** window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Timeout Policies](/unified/configuring-timeout-policies).
You can only use the **Authentication Timeout** setting within your policy rule if your users are running Zscaler Client Connector version 1.2.1 or later.
