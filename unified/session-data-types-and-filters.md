There are two ways to view Session data types and filters to define Session traffic information. You can view them on a dashboard or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/unified/analyzing-traffic-using-insights-0).
On the **Logs** > **Insights** > **Branch & Cloud Connectors** > **Session Insights** page, select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the **Add Filter** menu on the left-side navigation.
