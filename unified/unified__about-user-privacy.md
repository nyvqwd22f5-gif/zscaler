From the Admin Portal, you can configure user privacy for various settings.
Zscaler Client Connector User Privacy settings provide you with the following benefits and allow you to:
- Comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by disabling or enabling the collection of device owner and machine hostname information.
- Enable packet capture and allow non-administrator users access to log files for troubleshooting.
- Restrict packet capture to only administrators.
- Protect user information by disabling automatic uploading of crash reports.
- Collect geolocation information if Digital Experience Monitoring is enabled on a device.
- Provide users flexibility by allowing them to change default parameters for Zscaler Tunnel (Z-Tunnel) 2.0 or Private Applications protocol settings.
- Protect traffic from malicious PAC files by enforcing secure PAC URLs.
