Predefined applications are made with readily available data in the ZDX service to allow fast and seamless configuration. To learn more, see [About Applications](/zdx/about-applications).
To configure a predefined application:
- Go to **Configuration > Applications.**
- Choose an application from the [Predefined Applications list](/zdx/predefined-applications-zdx). Click the arrow next to the application's name. Depending on the application, either click **Go **or enter your tenant ID information.
The **Status** column shows that the application and its preconfigured web and cloud path probes have been **Enabled**. The **Status **for predefined applications that are not yet fully activated appears as **Pending Onboard** in the Predefined Applications list.

- Click **Save** and [activate your changes](/zdx/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
