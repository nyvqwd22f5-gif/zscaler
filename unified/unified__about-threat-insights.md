The Threat Insights page allows you to visually see organization-specific threats in the form of paths from origins to targets. You can choose to view threat statistics in a 2D map or a 3D globe.
- [2D Map](#map)
- [3D Globe](#globe)
Threat Insights provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Efficiently analyze the threat data by showing the precise location of the threat origin and its path to the target.
- Modify your traffic policies accordingly against potential threats by showing the precise location of the threat origin and its path to the target.
- Quickly pinpoint the traffic policy that you need to reconfigure for stronger rules to make your organization less vulnerable to cyber attacks. You're able to do this by looking at percentages showing attacks by threat category, top targets, and top threat origins.
