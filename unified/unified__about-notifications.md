Notifications provide information about events related to components, event information (e.g., high CPU), and relevant values associated with the events. Admins subscribe to receive alert notifications from the Admin Portal by email. On the Notifications page, an admin can filter and view notifications.
Notifications provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Receive notifications from the Admin Portal about events that are related to components, event information, and relevant values associated with the events.
- Configure events related to component enrollment, component connectivity and upgrades, component usage metrics, and system resources.
