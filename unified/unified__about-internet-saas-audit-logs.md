Zscaler records the actions of every admin in the Admin Portal and the actions that occur through the Internet & SaaS APIs.
Audit logs provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View alterations made to the Admin Portal, such as PAC file modifications or URL filtering policy alterations.
- View details on all the changes made by an administrator during a login session.
- Use them frequently to demonstrate compliance with security policies.
- Detect and investigate suspicious activity and track unauthorized access to the administrative user interface.
If an admin account makes 5 unsuccessful attempts to log in within 1 minute, the account is locked out for 5 minutes and the failed attempts are recorded in the audit log. The audit logs are stored for up to 6 months.
About the Internet & SaaS Audit Logs Page
On the Audit Logs page (Administration > Admin Management > Audit Logs > Internet & SaaS), you can do the following:
- Filter by time range, action, category, sub-category, interface, and/or result.
- Search for an audit log by resource, admin ID, client IP, trace ID, or configuration changes. The search only shows results starting with or completely matching the search string.
- Download a CSV file. The times in the CSV file are in PDT.
- View a list of actions that have occurred. For each action, you can see:
- **Timestamp**: The date and local time the action occurred.
- **Action**:** **The action performed by the admin in the Admin Portal or the action performed by an API.
- [List of all potential actions](#action)
- **Category**: A location in the Admin Portal where the action was performed by a user or an API.
- [List of all potential categories](#category)
- **Sub-Category**: The subject under the selected category.
- [List of all potential sub-categories](#sub)
- **Resource**: The specific subject within a sub-category. For example, if an admin adds a new admin, then the resource is the name of the admin that was added.
- **Admin ID**: The admin's login ID or the internal API user (`oauth-<rolename>$@<orgid>.<cloud-domain>`) if an APIs action was authenticated by an external OAuth 2.0 authentication server.
- **Client IP**: The source IP address for the admin or the client application's IP address that executed the API.
- **Interface**: The means by which the action was performed.
- The interface values are: **Admin UI** or **API**.
- **Trace ID**: The trace ID is generated and logged for transactions associated with Internet & SaaS API requests made via Zscaler OneAPI. The trace ID helps admins correlate API transactions with the OneAPI platform, and you can use the trace ID for debugging purposes.
- **Result**: The outcome of an action.
- If the action was a success, a green circle with a checkmark inside is displayed.
- If the action was a failure, a red circle with an X inside is displayed.
