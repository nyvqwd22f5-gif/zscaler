Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision [users](/unified/about-users), [groups](/unified/about-groups), and [departments](/unified/about-departments) as described in [ZIdentity Authentication](/zidentity/authentication). This article describes how to view or download user accounts on the Users page as well as provides an overview of its features. You can add up to 1400K users as described in [ZIdentity Users](/zidentity/administration/users). For a complete list of ranges and limits per feature, see [Ranges & Limitations](/unified/ranges-limitations#internet-saas).
Users provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Download a list of users within your organization who have access to the Internet & SaaS service.
- View users enrolled for the Internet & SaaS service.
On the Users page, users are listed as view-only with limited options (i.e., download user data and search for users) as you're subscribed to the ZIdentity service. To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
