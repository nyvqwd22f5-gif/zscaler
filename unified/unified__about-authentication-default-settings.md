The Zscaler service supports SAML, SCIM, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) as described in [ZIdentity Authentication](/zidentity/authentication). To learn more about authenticating users, see [About Provisioning and Authenticating Users](/unified/about-provisioning-and-authenticating-users).
On the Default Settings page (Administration > Identity > Internet & SaaS > Internet Authentication Settings), you can [configure the authentication frequency](/unified/configuring-default-authentication-profile) in the default authentication profile for the authentication method you choose.
This feature is in limited availability. To access this feature, contact your Zscaler Account team.
