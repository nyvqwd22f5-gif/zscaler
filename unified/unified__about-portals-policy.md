You can configure rules for a Privileged Remote Access (PRA) Portal with a portals policy. Portals policy rules allow you to delete uploaded files, upload inspected files, upload inspected Internet & SaaS Sandbox files, and access uninspected files in the [Privileged Remote Access (PRA) File Transfer System pages](/unified/about-privileged-remote-access-pra-file-transfer-system). Portals policies allow users to access the PRA File Transfer System pages in the [PRA Portal](/unified/accessing-privileged-remote-access-portal) they assign the rule to.
Portals policy rules include the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage the permissions that provide the ability to upload inspected files and access uninspected files.
- Access the PRA File Transfer System feature in a PRA Portal.
- Control the file uploads for PRA.
If you want to configure portals policies, you must first create the [privileged portals](/unified/about-privileged-portals) that you want to assign control to.
About the Portals Policy Page
On the Portals Policy page, you can do the following:
- Expand all the displayed rows in the table to see more information about each policy rule.
- Show all the rules in the table. The rows remain collapsed. Depending on the number of rules, this can take a few minutes.
By default, the table only displays the first 100 rules. Alternatively, you can scroll to see more rules. If there are more than 1,000 rules, **Display All Rules** is not visible.
- [Add a new portals policy rule.](/unified/configuring-portals-policies)
