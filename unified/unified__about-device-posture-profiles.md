The Device Posture profile is a set of criteria evaluated on devices. Policies in both Internet & SaaS and Private Applications can be configured based on the outcome of this evaluation. For example, if you specify a file path in a device posture profile, the user has access to the application if the user's system has the file specified in the posture profile.
Device posture profiles provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Determine access to corporate resources and public applications based on the device posture you set.
- Ensure a minimum security level is present on the device before allowing access.
You can define the posture profiles in the Device Posture section. You must [configure these device posture profiles](/unified/configuring-device-posture-profiles) in the Admin Portal. You can use posture profiles when configuring [access policies](/unified/configuring-access-policies) in the Admin Portal and when [adding posture profile trust levels](/unified/adding-internet-saas-posture-profiles) for Internet & SaaS.
Each posture profile has its own set criteria. To learn more about each posture type, see [Configuring Device Posture Profiles](/unified/configuring-device-posture-profiles).
Device Posture Evaluation
Zscaler Client Connector evaluates device posture profiles every 15 minutes. New connections are established based on updated security postures. Existing connections are not affected by updates to security postures.
For Zscaler Client Connector version 4.4 and later for Windows, you can configure how often Zscaler Client Connector evaluates the device posture profile. To learn more, see [Configuring Device Posture Profiles](/unified/configuring-device-posture-profiles).
The following network changes can trigger a device posture evaluation:
- The Zscaler service restarts
- A device:
- Reboots
- Joins a network
- Comes out of hibernation
- Moves from non-domain joined to domain-joined
- Moves from a Wi-Fi connection to an Ethernet connection
- Changes Wi-Fi networks
