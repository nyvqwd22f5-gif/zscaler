You can schedule standard and custom reports for regular distribution to specified recipients. For example, you can schedule the Web Overview report for weekly distribution to your IT department and CIO.
An organization can schedule up to 500 reports. A report can be associated with many schedules. This is useful, for example, when a super admin wants to schedule the same reports for various department managers in different time zones.
The scheduled report always reflects the current parameters of the report that is scheduled. For example, if an administrator changes the user filter of a User Browsing History report from User 1 to User 2, the report will display the activity of User 2 after the parameter change.
The scheduled reports are emailed as links to the recipients. When the recipients click the link, they see the report in Print View. Anyone who has the link can access the report. The link is valid for 15 days only.
