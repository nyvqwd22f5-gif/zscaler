Occasionally, you might need to edit an API key in the Admin Portal.
The client secret is only available to copy when [creating an API key](/unified/adding-api-key). It is not available by editing the key.
To edit an API key:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Administration** > **API Configuration > Legacy API > Client Connector API**.
- In the table, locate the key you want to modify and click the **Edit** icon.
- In the **Edit API Key** window, modify fields as necessary. To learn more about each field, see [Adding an API Key](/unified/adding-api-key).
