Zscaler Extranet Application Support allows Private Applications users to access private applications hosted on a business partner's network, eliminating the need to install any application connectors on the partner's network or connect a data center to a partner's. With Zscaler Extranet Application Support, your organization's partners can establish [IPSec tunnels](/unified/configuring-ipsec-vpn-tunnel) directly to the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE). Extranets are created and assigned to [locations](/unified/about-locations) in the Admin Portal. After an extranet location is configured in Internet & SaaS, a Private Applications admin can use it to configure [server groups](/unified/configuring-server-groups) and [application segments](/unified/configuring-defined-application-segments), which can be managed with [Private Applications access policies](/unified/configuring-access-policies). To learn more, see [Understanding Extranet Application Support](/unified/understanding-extranet-application-support).
Extranet Application Support is a feature in limited availability. To access Extranet Application Support, contact your Zscaler Account team.
Extranet Application Support provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Securely access partner resources that are not integrated with the Zscaler service.
- View [Insights](/unified/about-insights) and [Insights logs](/unified/about-insights-logs) for configured extranets.
- Manage access to extranet resources with Private Applications.
