[Bandwidth classes](/unified/about-bandwidth-classes) identify the [URL categories](/unified/about-url-categories) and [cloud applications](/unified/about-cloud-app-control) to which the service allocates bandwidth. You can group URL categories or applications into bandwidth classes, and then reference them in [Bandwidth Control](/unified/about-bandwidth-control) policy rules.
The **Web Conferencing Applications** tab lists the web conferencing applications that can be included in this class.
To specify the applications belong to this bandwidth class:
- Go to **Infrastructure **>** Internet & SaaS **>** Network Policies **>** Bandwidth Classes **to [manage bandwidth classes](/unified/adding-bandwidth-classes).
- Go to the **Web Conferencing Applications **tab.
- Enable or disable applications as necessary.
- Click **Save** and activate the changes.
