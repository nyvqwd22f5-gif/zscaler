A [subcloud](/unified/understanding-subclouds) is a subset of Internet & SaaS Public Service Edges, which are full-featured secure internet gateways that inspect all web traffic bi-directionally for malware, and enforce security, compliance, and next-generation firewall (NGFW) policies. Internet & SaaS Public Service Edges are deployed in Zscaler data centers around the globe, so when your users move to a different location, they can access the internet from any device and the Internet & SaaS Public Service Edges protect their traffic and apply your corporate policies.
Subclouds provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Ensure traffic from Zscaler Client Connector, PAC, or SD-WAN only connects to specific Zscaler data centers.
- Allow Zscaler Client Connector and PAC file users to securely connect to regional surcharge data centers.
- Redirect Zscaler Client Connector and PAC file users to the next closest data center.
- Allow Zscaler Client Connector and PAC file users to securely connect to privately hosted data centers.
