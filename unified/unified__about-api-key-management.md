Zscaler Client Connector gives you programmatic access through APIs to manage Zscaler Client Connector features. An API key is required to access the publicly available set of Zscaler Client Connector APIs. An API key consists of a client ID and a client secret. Both are required for authentication prior to accessing a publicly available set of Zscaler Client Connector APIs.
Generating an API key only occurs in the Admin Portal from the Public API page. Client IDs are always accessible from the page. Client secrets are only displayed when the key is first created, and they are not available in the saved configuration.
About the Public API Page
On the API Keys page (Administration > API Configuration > Legacy API > Client Connector API), you can:
- [Add an API key](/unified/adding-api-key).
- View a list of all the API keys.
- Copy an API key to your clipboard.
The client secret is only available to copy when creating an API key.
- [Edit an API key](/unified/editing-api-key).
- Delete an API key.
