Zscaler automatically creates a profile for each account where you can change your display language, time zone, password, and default Zscaler cloud.
To view and change your account settings in the Admin Portal:
- On the top navigation menu, click the **Account **icon on the right to display the **Account **menu. If your organization has multiple [private access microtenants](/unified/about-private-app-microtenants), you can select the one you want from the drop-down menu under **Private Access Microtenant**.

You can see your login ID, your organization's unique identifier, and the Zscaler cloud to which your organization has been provisioned,
- Under **Settings**, you can edit the following:
- **Language**: In some locations, you can switch to another language in which to view the user interface. The Admin Portal supports the following languages:
- English (US)
- Chinese (Traditional)
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Spanish
- **Time Zone**: Change your local time zone. When the Zscaler service saves transactions, it uses UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The time zone is used only for exporting logs to CSV files. It does not affect the generated logs in the Admin Portal because the system time zone determines the time stamp of the generated logs.
- **Password**: Change your password for the Admin Portal. The Zscaler service applies the strongest restrictions and complexity. The password must contain at least 8 characters and include one number, one upper-case character, and one special character. Only ASCII characters are allowed.
- **Theme**: Choose the display setting that will be applied to the Admin Portal for your account:
- **Light Theme**: The light mode display theme will always be used.
- **Dark Theme**: The dark mode display theme will always be used.
- **System Theme**: Applies your device's system display theme preference.
- **Default Zscaler Cloud**: Select the Zscaler cloud you want to log in to by default.
- Click **Save.**
