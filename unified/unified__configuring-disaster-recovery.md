Enabling disaster recovery ensures business continuity in the event of a disaster scenario that impacts the global Zscaler cloud infrastructure. Disaster recovery is for organizations that depend on the Zscaler cloud to remain operational during disaster events by providing users with access to critical applications. Zscaler provides support for disaster recovery in both Internet & SaaS and Private Applications.
The Internet & SaaS Disaster Recovery mode is only available to enrolled users.
