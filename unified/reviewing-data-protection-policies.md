Data protection policies protect your organization from users intentionally or unintentionally leaking data via attachments or social media.
Zscaler provides the following types of data protection:
- **Visibility & Classification**: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) dictionaries contain algorithms to inspect user traffic for potential data leakage, such as bank information, PII, sensitive file formats and more. To learn more, see [About DLP Dictionaries](/unified/about-dlp-dictionaries).
- **Data Classification Dashboard**: This dashboard gives you high-level visibility and insight into your organization's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) content. To learn more, see [About the Data Discovery Report](/unified/about-data-discovery-report).
During onboarding, Zscaler sets up its default set of data protection policies. You can fine-tune these policies later in the Admin Portal. To learn more about Zscaler's data protection, see [About Data Loss Prevention](/unified/about-data-loss-prevention).
