Cloud app categories are a key part of [Cloud App Control](/unified/about-cloud-app-control). The service organizes cloud applications into 19 categories. For 14 of the categories, you can [create rules](/unified/adding-rules-cloud-app-control-policy) with allow or block options. For the other 5 categories, you can create rules to control the specific actions a user can take within the application.
