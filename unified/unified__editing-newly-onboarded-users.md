After you have onboarded users to Zscaler by [importing them from your IdP](/unified/importing-users-idp), [uploading them from a CSV](/unified/uploading-users-csv-file), or [adding them manually](/unified/adding-users-manually) you can make edits to those users, add more users, or change a user's role before completing the onboarding process. You can also update or add users in the Admin Portal after onboarding is complete.
After you have imported, uploaded, or added a user the **Users **page is displayed, showing the list of users. The list can consist of multiple pages.

At least one user in your organization must be a Full Admin. If you delete or remove admin privileges from the only Full Admin user, you will be prompted to select a different user to become a Full Admin.

Click the **Edit **icon next to a user to change the user's name, email address or change the user role between End User or Full Admin and click **Save**.
During onboarding, you can only [assign users to either the Full Admin or End User role](/unified/setting-up-secure-access#add-users). However, after you complete onboarding, any Full Admin can assign users to other admin roles from the Admin Portal.
To learn more about Internet & SaaS roles, see [Adding Admin Roles](/unified/adding-admin-roles). To learn more about Private Applications roles, see [About Roles](/unified/about-roles). To learn more about Client Connector roles, see [Adding Roles](/unified/adding-roles).
- Click the **Delete **icon next to a user you want to remove. You cannot delete individual users that were imported from an IdP.
