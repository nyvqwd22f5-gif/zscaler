The Metrics NSS feed specifies the data from the Metrics logs that the Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) sends to the security information and event management (SIEM) system. You can configure an NSS feed by including one or more fields. The fields and their values display in the NSS feed output.
There are three types of Metrics logs that each Zscaler Cloud Connector generates:
- **VM**: Metrics that are applicable at the virtual machine (VM) level.
- **Instance**: Metrics that are applicable at the level of an individual data-processing instance. There are multiple data-processing instances in a single Cloud Connector.
- **Resource**: Metrics that are applicable at an individual resource level. There are physical and logical resources in a Cloud Connector that all data-processing instances use.
The following tables display information about the Metrics fields and possible values for those fields.
VM
VM Metrics logs are applicable to an entire Cloud Connector VM. These metrics are collected at one-minute intervals. There is one log line per minute for each Cloud Connector.

VM NSS feeds consist of all metrics at the VM level, such as CPU and memory. You can use the VM-level Metrics logs to monitor resource usage at the VM level. For example, you can configure alerts on the SIEM side to monitor the CPU or memory utilization when they cross a defined threshold.
Instance
Each Cloud Connector has between one and three data-processing instances, depending on the form factor. This feed is used for metrics specific to a data-processing instance. These metrics are collected at one-minute intervals. There is one log line per minute for each data-processing instance.

Instance NSS feeds contain metrics at the instance level. Users can monitor the instance-level resource usage, such as the CPU, memory, and throughput. There is also a `%s{nodata}` field, which is set to `True` when no data is available. This value indicates an issue on the connector instance service in which the metrics samples were not collected.
Resource
Each Cloud Connector has physical or logical resources, such as disk partitions and Network Interface Cards (NICs). Resources are used for metrics specific to a resource. These metrics are collected at one-minute intervals. There is one log line per minute for each resource.
The log line for each resource type has a set of applicable metrics. Metrics that are not applicable to that resource are set to zero or absent from the log line. The applicable set of metrics depends on the resource type.

Resource NSS feeds consist of metrics at the resource level. For example, a resource can be a disk partition. You can set up your SIEM to monitor the usage of disk partitions and send notifications when necessary. Resource Metrics are present in the feed if that counter is applicable to the resource type to which the metric is published. For example, metrics related to disk usage are available for the disk resource type.
