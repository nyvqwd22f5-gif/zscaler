The Zscaler service hosts 4 default PAC files: recommended.pac, proxy.pac, mobile_proxy.pac, and kerberos.pac. These files are all configured to automatically forward all browser traffic to the nearest ZIA Public Service Edge. The default PAC files are non-editable, but you can copy them to create and build your custom PAC files. Your organization can use more than one PAC file. For example, you can use one PAC file for mobile devices and another for all other devices. Zscaler recommends using the Kerberos PAC file if you are deploying [Kerberos authentication](/zia/about-kerberos-authentication).
To forward web traffic to the Zscaler service, you can use a [default PAC file](/zia/how-do-i-use-default-pac-files-forward-traffic-zia) or a [custom PAC file](/zia/how-do-i-use-custom-pac-file-forward-traffic-zia). PAC servers support both HTTP and HTTPS. To use a PAC file with HTTPS, change the PAC file URL string from `http` to `https`. HTTPS is recommended for additional security.
Hosted PAC files provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure custom PAC files to forward your organization's traffic to the desired ZIA Public Service Edge.
- Configure and host up to 10 versions of your PAC files in the Zscaler cloud to ensure the availability of the PAC file with assured uptime.
- Leverage the [Zscaler-specific PAC variables](/zia/writing-pac-file#zscaler-variables) to design optimal custom PAC files.
