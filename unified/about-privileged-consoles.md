After you have created a privileged portal, you can create and edit privileged consoles on the Privileged Consoles page. After a privileged console is created, you can enable it to appear on the end user’s Privileged Remote Access (PRA) portal. You can enable the same privileged console to appear in one or more privileged portals.
Privileged consoles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create privileged consoles that allow end users to access the systems they want to connect to.
- Manage which privileged portals the privileged consoles are assigned to.
- Update the description for privileged consoles that are displayed to end users.
About the Privileged Consoles Page
On the Privileged Consoles page (Resource Management > Privileged Remote Access > Privileged Consoles), you can:
- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables).
- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to display the filters.
- Refresh the Privileged Consoles page.
- Filter the list of privileged consoles linked to a specific privileged portal. By default, all privileged consoles are displayed. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables).
- [Add a new privileged console](/zpa/configuring-privileged-consoles).
- Expand all rows in the table to see more information about each privileged console.
- View a list of all the privileged consoles that are configured for your organization. For each console, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the privileged console.
- **Description**: The description for the privileged console, if available.
- **Display on Console**: Enable to display the privileged console on the end user’s Privileged Remote Access portal.
- **Protocol**: The types of consoles that can be used for Privileged Remote Access are VNC, SSH, or RDP.
- **Domain**: A valid domain name.
- **Port**: The port number used for the console.
- [Edit an existing privileged console](/zpa/editing-privileged-portals).
- Delete an existing privileged console.
If you delete a privileged console, you can no longer form a new connection and the privileged console is removed from the end user's Privileged Remote Access portal. If there are any existing connections prior to the deletion of the privileged console, these connections remain accessible until the browser is closed.
