The Log and Control Forwarding policy allows you to control how the traffic logs and the operational messages are being forwarded to the Zscaler cloud. The policy controls items such as enrollment, policy changes, software updates, and sending logs. A default log and control forwarding rule with a default gateway forwarding action is automatically created.
Log and control forwarding provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Configure the primary and secondary gateways used for setting up control channels and forwarding logs.
- Configure log and control forwarding with more granularity.
