The service provides predefined network applications. A network application group enables you to group applications together. This simplifies the creation of your Firewall policy.
Network application groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Group network applications into a single entity to manage them collectively in security policies.
- Configure firewall filtering rules based on network application groups and enforce condition-based actions to allow or block traffic.
To facilitate rule creation for Microsoft Office 365 apps, there is a predefined Office 365 application group.
