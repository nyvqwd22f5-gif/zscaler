# Configuring Authentication Levels

An authentication level in ZIdentity represents a specific strength of authentication with hierarchical levels where higher levels represent stronger authentication methods. When users are authenticated at a higher level, their authentication level satisfies policies that require a sub-level of authentication. These authentication levels are mapped with access policies in supported Zscaler services to enable step-up authentication for resources.
To configure an authentication level:
-
Go to **Administration **> **Identity **> **ZIdentity** > **Authentication Levels**.
The **Authentication Levels** page appears.
-
On the **Authentication Levels** page:
- Click **New Authentication Level**.
- **Level Name**: Enter a name for the level.
- **Validity**: Enter a validity period for this level of authentication. You can specify the validity period in minutes, hours, or days.
- **Description**: Enter a description for the level.
- **Message to the user (optional)**: Enter a message that you want to be shown to the users via Zscaler Client Connector notifications while accessing resources that require this level of authentication.
- (Optional) If you want to create sub-levels of authentication with different authentication contexts:
- Click **Create level **beneath the level you want to add a sub-level.
- **Sub-Level** **Name**: Enter a name for the sub-level.
- **Validity**: Enter a validity period for this level of authentication. You can specify the validity period in minutes, hours, or days.
- **Description**: Enter a description for the sub-level.
- **Message to the user (optional)**: Enter a message that you want to be shown to the users via Zscaler Client Connector notifications while accessing resources that require this level of authentication.

Click **Save**.
- You can create multiple sub-levels forming a tree hierarchy. A tree can contain a total of up to 32 authentication levels and the maximum depth for any branch cannot exceed 4.
- The validity period for a parent level must be less than the validity period defined for any of its sub-levels.
After configuring authentication levels, you need to create access policies in the [supported Zscaler services](/unified/understanding-step-authentication).
If you have configured external IdP for authentication via OIDC, you need to map the authentication levels to their respective `acr` values in the IdP. To learn more about external IdPs, see [About External Identity Providers](/unified/about-external-identity-providers).
