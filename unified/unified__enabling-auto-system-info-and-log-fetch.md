This feature allows Zscaler to retrieve and analyze Zscaler Client Connector log bundles to expedite resolution of customer-reported issues and to proactively resolve internal issues. Zscaler recommends enabling this feature. When enabled, Zscaler Client Connector collects the information and holds it in secure cloud storage where only Zscaler Support can access it. This feature is disabled by default.
The information collected includes personally identifiable information (PII). To learn more about how Zscaler handles PII, see the [Zscaler Privacy FAQ](https://www.zscaler.com/privacy/faq).
To enable this feature:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure** > **Connectors** > **Client** > **User Privacy**.
-
On the **User Privacy** tab, select **Enable Auto System Info and Log Fetch**.
