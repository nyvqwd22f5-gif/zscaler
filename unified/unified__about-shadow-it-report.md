The Shadow IT Report shows the number of sanctioned and unsanctioned applications being used and their number of users. It also shows the application categories, the risk index, and the certifications for each application. Zscaler supports up to 50K cloud applications.
Shadow IT has drastically grown in recent years, especially with the adoption of multiple applications. These applications are installed by bypassing the IT department's approval for different reasons, like the ease of setting up applications with fewer approval stages and bottlenecks, the application being more efficient than the choices provided by the organization, etc.
On the other hand, IT departments also appreciate fewer application requests so that they can direct their focus on more business-critical tasks. But oversight of the IT department can lead to significant security risks. These unsanctioned applications must come under the radar of your IT team or relevant department at some stage to monitor their vulnerabilities and mitigate the exploitation surface for the attackers.
The Shadow IT Report provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Discover and manage shadow IT applications used by your organization's user, department, or location.
- Gain comprehensive visibility and assurance for SaaS applications by scrutinizing them across multiple risk attributes to demonstrate trustworthiness.
- Analyze and secure your organization's traffic from potential threats and vulnerabilities posed by the usage of these applications.
- View the report from different perspectives, like users, location, risk level, data consumption, security certifications, etc. and build your organization's shadow IT traffic resilient to cyberattacks.
- Increase the visibility of your SaaS applications by viewing security events generated by the Zscaler service and other third-party vendor devices, like Palo Alto Networks.
About the Shadow IT Report Page

- **Source:** You can view the report generated by the Zscaler service or a third-party vendor (e.g., Palo Alto Networks). The third-party data is displayed by ingesting near real-time firewall and web proxy logs, then collecting necessary data points, masking sensitive information, and securely streaming the data further to the Zscaler cloud for Shadow IT reporting.
- **For:** You can view data from the last 1 day, 7 days, 15 days, month, or quarter. The default time is the last 7 days.
- **Overview**: The following sections are an overview of the applications. The information in these sections changes according to the filters that you select.
- **Total** **Applications**: The total number of sanctioned and unsanctioned applications that are in use.
- **Total Bytes**: The total bytes consumed by all the applications, both upload and download.
- **Upload Bytes**: The total upload bytes for all the applications.

[]View the hosting and security characteristics of each application. You can modify the characteristics:
- **Yes**: has the characteristic
- **No**: does not have the characteristic
- **Unknown**: not determined
- **All**: considers all the preceding options
- **Poor Terms of Service**: Checks the legal terms and conditions that include questionable parameters (e.g., if the application uses shared customer data for other purposes or with other third-party applications).
- **Data Breaches in the Last 3 Years**: Checks if the application reported a known data breach.
- **Source IP Restrictions**: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
Checks if the application provides options to allow or restrict access from specific IP addresses. If the application does not provide this option, the attack surface widens as anyone can access the application.
- **MFA Support**: Checks if the application supports multi-factor authentication.
- **Admin Audit Logs**: Checks if the application supports logging or provides a trail of all admin activities. This helps in identifying any malicious or anomalous activities.
- **SSL Pinned**: Checks if the application has SSL certification pinned. Pinned certificates make the traffic difficult to decrypt and validate its contents, which can have malicious files.
- **Data Encryption in Transit**: Checks the minimum TLS version that the application supports. The latest TLS version is the most secure. Applications still using any version earlier than TLS 1.1 are considered less secure.
- **Evasive**: Checks if the application supports accessing data anonymously without expecting the user to create an account and log in. If there is no login option, anyone can access the application anonymously without providing their identity. For example, some applications allow users to share files without authenticating them. This can lead malicious users to spread malware and makes identifying the user difficult.
- **HTTP Security Header Support**: Checks if all security headers (i.e., X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options) are securely implemented.
- **Valid SSL Certificate**: Checks if the application's SSL certificate is valid or not.
- **Published CVE Vulnerability**: Checks if the application has published CVE vulnerabilities.
- **DNS CAA Policy**: The DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) is an internet security policy mechanism. Domain name holders indicate to certificate authorities whether they are authorized to issue digital certificates for a particular domain name. This attribute captures if domains mention particular CAA authorities for this application.
- **Weak Cipher Support**: Checks for weak ciphers. Ciphers are also known as encryption or decryption algorithms. This attribute indicates key sizes that are less than 128 bits. The keys are used for making SSL connections with the servers.
- **File Sharing**: Checks if the application supports file sharing, which can be risky as content can be shared outside the organization by users.
- **Vulnerable to Heartbleed**: Checks if the application is vulnerable to a Heartbleed attack.
- **Vulnerable to POODLE**: Checks if the application is vulnerable to POODLE attack.
- **Vulnerable to Logjam**: Checks if the application is vulnerable to Logjam attack.
- **Support for WAF**: Checks if the application supports web application firewall (WAF).
- **Remote Access Screen Sharing**: Checks if the application supports remote access screen sharing. This can be risky as it widens the attack surface. If a malicious user gets hold of a valid remote access session, it can lead to data exfiltration.
- **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**: Checks if the application has a vulnerability disclosure policy. Applications should provide this option so that ethical users or hackers can report on any misconfigurations that could lead to attacks.
- **Sender Policy Framework**: Checks if the application supports sender policy framework (SPF) authentication. SPF authentication works by strictly specifying the number of allowed domain IP addresses that can send emails from your domain. When setting up SPF, the domain owner adds a file or record on the server which indicates to the receiving server what domains are allowed to send emails.
- **DomainKeys Identified Mail**: Checks if the application supports DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). DKIM authentication is similar to SPF; this is added as a TXT record by adding it in your domain panel. It makes sure that none of the emails going from server to server are tampered with by anyone in the middle and that emails can be clearly identified from the other end.
- **Domain-Based Message Authentication**: Checks if the application supports Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to further validate emails by verifying SPF and DKIM records. This enables you to configure policies in case DMARC validation fails, and it also generates reports.
