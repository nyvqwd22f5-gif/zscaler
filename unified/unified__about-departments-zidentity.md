This article describes how to add and manage departments. When you add administrators, you can define their scope by department. Administrators can have control over a set of users in a department. An administrator can belong to only one department.
Departments provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage admins and users based on their departments.
- View department-based reports.
- Categorize users based on departments specific to your organization.
On the Departments page (Administration > Identity > ZIdentity > Departments), you can do the following:
- [Add a department](/unified/adding-departments-0).
- [Import departments using a CSV file](/unified/adding-departments-0).
- View the list of configured departments. For each department, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the department.
- **Description**: A short description about the department.
- Edit a department.
- Delete a department.
- Search for a specific department.
- Refresh the page.
