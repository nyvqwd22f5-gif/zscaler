To help you navigate faster, you can search for menus in the Admin Portal. Search results include Admin Portal menus in the left-hand navigation (except for items in the Help menu) and do not include:
- Tabs
- Field names
- Toggle names
- Tooltips or other text
To search the Admin Portal:
- Hover over the **Search **icon in the navigation menu. The search panel appears.

- Enter your search text. The Admin Portal automatically activates the cursor in the search bar, so you don't need to click before typing.
The search provides auto-complete suggestions as you type, and keeps a history of your last 5 searches and last 5 pages visited.
