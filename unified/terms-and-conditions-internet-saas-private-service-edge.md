Internet & SaaS Private Service Edges are installed in an organization’s data center and are dedicated to the organization’s traffic, but they are managed and maintained by Zscaler Cloud Operations during the subscription period. Zscaler monitors and maintains the Service Edges with a near-zero touch from your organization. Service Edges are the property of Zscaler, and the organization cannot sell, lease, transfer, or attempt to repurpose the Service Edges in any other manner beyond operating them in accordance with Zscaler's following terms and conditions.
Zscaler's Responsibilities
Zscaler is responsible for the following tasks related to an organization's Service Edges:
-
Cover all logistical tasks and expenses, including all applicable customs processes and related matters, for all Service Edge hardware and components. Zscaler ensures end-to-end delivery of all Service Edge hardware to the shipping address provided by the organization, as well as coordinated retrieval of the Service Edges at the end of the subscription period, or in the event of hardware replacement.
Hardware shipments might take more than 6 weeks, depending on the organization’s location and local delivery requirements (custom clearance).
-
Upgrade or replace the Service Edges to maintain the operational standards of the Zscaler platform.
Zscaler provides updated equivalent hardware, software, or both at no additional cost to the organization, as long as the subscription is in good standing with Zscaler. To learn more about hardware, see [EOS and EOL Policy](/eos-eol/eos-and-eol-policy).
- Monitor the Service Edges to determine the overall health of the devices and software within the organization’s environment, and repair or otherwise replace any failed hardware.
- Alert the organization when Zscaler requires remote assistance, such as when a Service Edge needs to be rebooted.
- In the event of hardware failure, proactively contact the organization to further validate and troubleshoot the issue before proceeding with replacement processes.
- Provide periodic remote management of the Service Edge, including remote upgrades of software, on a schedule in conformance with the standard release and maintenance practices of the Internet & SaaS Cloud.
Organization's Responsibilities
For Zscaler Operations to service, manage, and maintain the Service Edges and ensure their smooth operation, Zscaler requires that the organization abide by the following requirements, broken down by section:
- Ensure that all provided shipping and location information is correct, and assist with any issues impacting delivery of the Service Edges.
- The organization further agrees that any costs incurred by Zscaler for storage, shipment return, or other items due to the organization's unresponsiveness or lack of support in providing a successful delivery shall be paid or reimbursed by the organization.
- Maintain the number of Service Edges recommended by Zscaler per installation location, with no fewer than two Service Edges for each installation location.
- Not to mishandle, neglect, abuse, vandalize, drop, jolt, incinerate, allow lightning or water damage (especially that caused by spilled beverages), or otherwise subject the Service Edges to unusual physical stress beyond Zscaler's specified operating capabilities.
- Provide a continuous, uninterrupted, and suitable network & power-hosting environment in accordance with [Zscaler installation documentation](/unified/installing-internet-saas-private-service-edge).
- Provide all necessary IP addresses and supporting installation requirements for the approved design.
- Comply with the [firewall configuration requirements](/unified/firewall-configuration-requirements-internet-saas-private-service-edge-deployments) if using a firewall or Access Control List-type device to control access to the Service Edges.
- Ensure temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions recommended by Zscaler are implemented and reasonably maintained.
- Implement suitable surge-protection devices.
- Ensure that each Service Edge has internet connectivity through no fewer than two discrete internet providers with redundant internet service capabilities.
- Manage and monitor all the organization's network and power-related issues.
- Provide all required network and power components, devices, and supporting accessories to complete installation.
- Notify Zscaler of any maintenance or scheduled windows that could impact Zscaler's ability to establish connectivity to the Service Edges.
- Ensure that the Service Edges are not moved from one physical location to another without prior approval and coordination from Zscaler.
- Ensure that only Zscaler staff access or service the Service Edges. The organization or any third party cannot make any repair attempts or other changes to the Service Edges unless they have explicit approval and guidance from Zscaler.
- Ensure that the Service Edges are installed and operated only in accordance with the specifications, recommendations, and software provided by Zscaler, and that no unsanctioned tests are performed without Zscaler’s explicit approval and coordination.
- Ensure that someone can respond 24/7 to requests from Zscaler, in case there is an issue with the organization's data center or Service Edges.
- The technical representative should at least have a general understanding of the customer's platform and the Service Edges.
- The technical representative must have physical access or be able to authorize and provide physical access to the Service Edges as requested by Zscaler.
Capacity Support
As an organization’s internet traffic continues to increase, it might be necessary to add additional Service Edges to some or all of the organization’s installation locations. If overutilization is detected, Zscaler will contact the organization to validate the need for a capacity increase. Accordingly, the organization will make all necessary arrangements in order to purchase and accommodate additional Service Edges within 30 days of notification by Zscaler, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.
If additional Service Edges cannot be accommodated at a given installation location, the organization must take action to reduce traffic utilization in accordance with Zscaler's guidance.
Exclusions and Disclaimers
Zscaler's exclusions and disclaimers for Service Edges are as follows:
Maintenance
Zscaler shall have no obligation to provide maintenance services for, or to otherwise support, any of the following:
- Third-party devices (whether hardware, software, cabling, or otherwise) that are not provided by Zscaler, or any issues with the Service Edges that might be caused by such third-party devices.
- Service Edges that have been modified by someone other than Zscaler personnel or Zscaler-authorized third parties.
- Service Edges damaged, whether by fire, power surge, unsanctioned testing, or other events, beyond Zscaler's reasonable control.
- Problems caused by any use of Service Edges in an environment other than that for which designed, as specified in the documentation.
- Any Service Edges obtained by any party other than Zscaler or partners.
- Any Service Edges where the organization is unresponsive, unwilling to assist with Zscaler’s troubleshooting requests, or does not have an active subscription to an applicable Service Edge product.
If the organization is unresponsive or unwilling to assist in installation, physical troubleshooting tasks, or both, Zscaler retains authorized contractors at a fixed hourly rate to be billed by Zscaler to the organization. Zscaler retains sole discretion on whether, when, and how to engage such contractors, and the organization must allow the authorized contractors physical access to the Service Edges in order to provide maintenance, repair, or replacement services.
Internet & SaaS Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
Zscaler shall not be liable for any claims or damages under these Service Edge terms, including but not limited to degradation or interruption of the Software as a Service (SaaS), resulting from the organization’s failure to comply with the preceding requirements, and such failure shall result in the invalidation of any and all Internet & SaaS SLAs and service credits for the SaaS.
