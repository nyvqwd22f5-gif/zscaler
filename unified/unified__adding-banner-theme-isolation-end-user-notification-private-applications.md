When a user in your organization enters an isolated session, an end user notification appears to notify them they are entering Isolation. This end user notification can be customized to align with an organization's look and feel.
Admins can manage custom banner themes for the end user notification that appears when a user in their organization enters Isolation. They can create and [edit](/unified/editing-banner-theme-isolation-end-user-notification-private-applications) as many custom themes as they want, and [delete](/unified/deleting-banner-theme-isolation-end-user-notification-private-applications) any that are not the default theme.
To add a banner theme:
- Go to **Policies** > **Access Control **> **Clientless **> **Banners**.
- Click **Add Theme**.
The **Add Isolation Banner** window appears
- In the **Add Isolation Banner** window:
- View the **Live Preview** as you make your edits.
- Enter the **Theme Name**.
- Use the drop-down menu to select the **Logo Image** in a .jpeg or .png format. The maximum file size is 100 KB. If you don't want to use a logo in the end user notification, click **Remove Logo**.
- Select the **Primary Color** that displays on the banner background.
- Select the **Text Color.**
- Enable or disable **Show Welcome Notification**. Disabling this means the end user notification will not appear in the isolated session for any profiles using this banner theme.
- Enter the **Notification Title**.
- Enter the **Notification Text**.
When in mobile isolation, links added to the Notification Text are disabled by default. To learn more, see [Limits in Isolation](/unified/limits-isolation).
