The Zscaler Client Connector supports the following languages for [end user notifications](/zia/about-zscaler-client-connector-based-end-user-notifications) (EUNs):
- English
- Chinese (Traditional)
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Spanish
The EUN language is based on the OS language setting in your system. The Zscaler Client Connector automatically detects your systems’ OS language and displays EUNs in that language. If your systems’ OS language is different from the EUN supported languages, Zscaler Client Connector displays EUNs in English, by default.
Only the default messages are translated to all the languages that the Zscaler Client Connector supports. You can modify the default messages per language. Modifying the message in a specific language does not impact the respective message in other languages. Zscaler Client Connector does not automatically translate customized messages.
