Branding allows you to add your organization's logo and customize the email that users receive to access the ZIdentity Admin Portal. The custom logo appears on the login, logout, and password reset pages. The email that Zscaler sends is rebranded and sent from the custom email address.
Only [admins with Full permissions](/zidentity/admin-roles-and-permissions) can customize the logo and email address.
To customize the logo and email:
-
Go to **Administration** > **Environment **> **Branding**.
The **Branding** page appears with the default Zscaler logo.
- Click **Edit Logo** to upload a different image.
-
Browse to the required folder and upload the image file in any required format.
The new logo is displayed on the page. This logo appears on the login and logout pages, and in emails.
The image size should not exceed 70 KB.
- In case you want to revert the changes, click **Delete**.
-
Under **Customize Email Subject**, change the email subject line for the following, if required:
- **New User Setup Link**
- **One-Time Code for MFA Enrollment**
- **One-Time Code for Email Change**
- **One-Time Code for Password Reset**
- **One-Time Code for Account Reset**
-
**Email OTP for Authentication**
The maximum length of the subject line is limited to 70 characters.
