Quarterly Business Review (QBR) reports for Digital Experience Monitoring provide extensive insight into how Zscaler is helping protect your network, quarter to quarter. The reports can help you observe emerging traffic trends and the types of threats that Zscaler is blocking. To learn more, see [Viewing Digital Experience Monitoring Quarterly Business Review Reports](/unified/viewing-digital-experience-monitoring-quarterly-business-review-reports).
A new QBR report is generated on the first weekend of every month, and each report is securely stored as a PowerPoint file in the Zscaler cloud. These reports are available to Digital Experience Monitoring users of all Digital Experience Monitoring subscription levels. If you don't see the reports, contact your support team or open a Zscaler Support ticket to have it enabled.
You must have a minimum of 100 active devices for 30 days to generate and view QBR reports.
You can download and view the reports from the left-side navigation of the Admin Portal:
