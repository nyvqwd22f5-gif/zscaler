You can copy an existing [Zscaler Client Connector App Profile](/unified/configuring-zscaler-client-connector-app-profiles) and change the settings to customize the profile to fit your needs instead of having to configure each setting in a profile. By duplicating an existing profile, you can test a profile before deploying it to reduce mistakes.
To copy a Zscaler Client Connector App Profile:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure > Connectors > Client**.
- Under Platform Settings, select the operating system.
- Click the **Copy **icon next to the profile you want to copy.
