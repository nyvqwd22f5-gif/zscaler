You can customize the parameters of the financial model that determines the financial exposure of your organization.
To customize the parameters:
-
Go to **Analytics > Risk360 > Financial Risk** > **Settings**.
The **Financial Risk Settings** drawer appears.
-
Under the** Default Values**, you can view the default values set for your organization during onboarding. To customize these values, under **Customized Values**:
- **Industry Vertical**: Select the industry vertical that best represents your organization.
- **Industry Annual Revenue Range**: Select the annual revenue range for the organization's industry vertical.
- **Financial Loss Range**: Enter the lower and upper bounds of the financial loss, in case your organization faces a breach. These values are used for simulating financial loss estimations within the set range.

You can click **Reset to Default** if you want the Risk360 service to use the default values for calculation.
The [Financial Risk](/unified/viewing-financial-risk) model inherits the latest values from the preceding settings to perform loss estimations.
