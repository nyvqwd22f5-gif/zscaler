Copilot is powered by AI/ML to become an interactive, conversational assistant to complement Digital Experience Monitoring. Admins can use Copilot to effectively combine a multitude of Digital Experience Monitoring features to optimize and compile users' details (e.g., data retrieval, summarization, or recognizing rising trends for an incident).
Copilot provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Deliver relevant insights and graphs or chart visualizations.
- Compress complex datasets into an intelligent summarization.
- Discover the root causes of user experience issues and offer recommendations for troubleshooting.
There are many different types of use cases for Copilot as it can interact with many Digital Experience Monitoring features. To learn more, see [Understanding Copilot with Use Cases](/unified/understanding-copilot-use-cases).
Copilot retains prompts and responses for a rolling period of 14 days as part of the session history. To learn more, see [ZDX Customer Logs and Data](/customer-logs-fair-use/zdx-customer-logs-and-data).
Copilot strives to assist with the most updated information, but can be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate in certain instances due to the subjective nature of generative AI/ML models.
