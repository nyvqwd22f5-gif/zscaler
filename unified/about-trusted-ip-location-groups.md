This article describes how to manage IP location groups on the Trusted IP Location Groups page. If you have many locations within your organization, consider using IP location groups. These location groups can be used to configure various [sign-on policies](/unified/about-sign-on-policies) for the users.
IP Location Groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Compile multiple IP locations into one group.
- Quickly configure [sign-on policies](/unified/about-sign-on-policies) for multiple locations in one attempt.
