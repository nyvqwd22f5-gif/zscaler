You can upgrade the Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) Module for Windows via the CLI if you want to deploy an upgrade separately from a Zscaler Client Connector upgrade. Before you can use a [downloaded package](/zscaler-client-connector/viewing-and-configuring-zdx-module-upgrades) to [upgrade via the CLI](/zscaler-client-connector/interacting-zscaler-client-connector-remotely), you must enable this feature.
This feature is available only for Zscaler Client Connector version 4.7 and later for Windows.
To enable ZDX Module upgrades via the CLI:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- In the left-side navigation, select **Platform Settings**.
- Select the **Windows** platform tab.
-
Enable **Allow ZDX Client Upgrade via CLI**.
