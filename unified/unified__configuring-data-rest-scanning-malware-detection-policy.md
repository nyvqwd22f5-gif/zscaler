The SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning [Malware Detection](/unified/about-data-rest-scanning-malware-detection) policy allows you to create rules to discover threats to data at rest in sanctioned SaaS applications.
In order to inspect content based on a configured policy rule's specifications, you must add it to a scan schedule. The Zscaler service does not inspect content until you configure a scan. To learn more, see [About SaaS Security Scan Configuration](/unified/about-saas-security-scan-configuration).
To configure the Malware Detection policy:
- Go to **Policies **>** Cybersecurity **>** SaaS Security API **>** Malware Scanning**.
- Choose one of the following SaaS application types from the drop-down menu:
- [Collaboration](#collaboration)
- [CRM](#crm)
- [Email](#email)
- [File Sharing](#filesharing)
- [ITSM](#ITSM)
- [Public Cloud Storage](#publiccloudstorage)
- [Source Code Repository](#sourcecoderepository)
[]To add a Malware Detection rule for collaboration applications:
-
Click **Add Malware Detection Rule**.
The **Add Malware Detection Rule** window appears.
- In the **Add Malware Detection Rule** window:
- **Application**: Select an application from the list.
