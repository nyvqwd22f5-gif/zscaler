Traffic Forwarding is used to forward select traffic to specific destinations based on your needs. For example, if you want to forward specific traffic through Internet & SaaS or application traffic through Private Applications, use the traffic forwarding method by configuring appropriate rules.
Traffic Forwarding provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Give granular control of traffic forwarding from cloud locations to Internet & SaaS or Private Applications.
- Grant the user the ability to bypass Internet & SaaS or Private Applications for a portion of workload traffic.
- Allow the user the ability to prevent traffic forwarding and drop selected workload traffic.
