The VPN Connected Users page shows a user's connection status to the VPN Service Edge. It also displays the username, assigned client IP address, connected VPN Service Edge, and the current VPN connection status.
VPN connected users provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View the IP addresses currently assigned to users on the network tunnel.
- View the status of a user's connected device.
About the VPN Connected Users Page
On the VPN Connected Users page (Infrastructure > Private Access > Component > VPN (For Legacy Apps) > VPN Connected Users), you can do the following:
- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/unified/using-tables#filterData).
- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to display the filters.
- Refresh the VPN Connected Users page to reflect the most current information.
- Filter the information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/unified/using-tables).
- View information about each VPN Connected User. For each user, you can see:
- **Username**: The email address of the user.
