To disable access to an application which was explicitly defined or dynamically discovered:
- Go to the **Application Segments** page (Policies > Access Control > Private Applications > App Segments).
- In the table, locate the application segment to which the application belongs and click the **Edit icon**.
-
In the **Edit Application Segment** window, for **Status**, select **Disabled**.
[See Image.](#status-disabled)
- Click **Save**.
Users will not be able to access the applications within the application segment until it is re-enabled.
