To edit an isolation policy rule:
- Go to **Policies** > **Access Control** > **Clientless** > **Isolation Policy**.
- Locate the isolation policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit icon**.
If you only want to change an isolation policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter in a new value on the [Isolation Policy page](/unified/about-isolation-policy).
- In the **Edit Isolation Policy **window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Isolation Policies](/unified/configuring-isolation-policies).
