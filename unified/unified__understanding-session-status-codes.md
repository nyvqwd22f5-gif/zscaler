Status codes are prefixed by the related Private Application component:
- AC: The App Connector component.
- CA: The Central Authority component.
- CLT: The Zscaler Client Connector component.
- SE: The Private Application Public Service Edge or Private Application Private Service Edge component.
- Private Application BA: The Browser Access service.
The types of session status codes available are:
- [Error Codes](#error-codes)
