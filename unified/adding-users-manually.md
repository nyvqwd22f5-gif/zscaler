In addition to [importing users via your identity provider (IdP)](/unified/importing-users-idp) or by [uploading them from a CSV file](/unified/uploading-users-csv-file), you can add users manually.
To add a single user:
- On the **Users** page, click **Add User**.
- Enter the user's first and last name and their email address within your organization.
-
Select the role you want to assign to this user.
- **End User**: a regular user who does not require any administrator access. These users are assigned to the ZIdentity Dynamic Group Registered Domains group.
- **Full Admin**: an administrator with full access to add, edit, import, and delete users within the Admin Portal. These users are assigned to the ZIdentity Global Administrators group. This type of user is commonly called a super admin.
To learn more about ZIdentity groups, see [About User Groups](/zslogin/about-user-groups).
- Click **Add User**.
- Repeat the steps above to add more users. From this page, you can also edit users you've already created or assign them to different roles. To learn more, see [Editing Newly Onboarded Users](/unified/editing-newly-onboarded-users).
