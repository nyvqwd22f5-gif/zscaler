A Branch Connector configuration template is required for both virtual machines (VMs) and hardware devices. The configuration template provides configuration information for virtual and physical branch devices, and the configuration URL is required for deploying both virtual and physical branch devices. For virtual branch devices, the administrator provides the configuration URL to the virtual device. For physical branch devices, the Zero Touch Provisioning process retrieves the configuration URL.
Configuring a Branch Connector template is part of adding a new Branch Connector appliance. The template pertains only to the appliance you are adding and cannot be applied to another Branch Connector appliance.
A Branch Connector Configuration Template provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Configure your Branch Connector instances.
- Set up high-availability deployment.
- Set the Zero Trust Branch Device to run as an inline gateway or non-gateway (One-Arm Mode).
- Preconfigure your Zero Trust Branch Devices for Zero Touch Provisioning.
See [Configuring a Branch Configuration Template](/unified/configuring-branch-configuration-template) for information about the initial configuration of a Branch Connector appliance. See [Managing a Zero Trust SD-WAN Device](/unified/managing-branch-connector-device) for information about modifying the configuration.
