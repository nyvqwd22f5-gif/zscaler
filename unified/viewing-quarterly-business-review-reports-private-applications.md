Quarterly Business Review (QBR) reports are available for download for all users. The reports provide extensive insight into emerging traffic trends based on private application usage and the types of threats Zscaler blocks to protect your network.
A new QBR report is generated on the first weekend of every month. However, if the first weekend falls on the first or second day of the month, then the report is generated on the following weekend. The QBR reports are securely stored as a PowerPoint file in the Zscaler cloud. The QBR reports are displayed for the last 3 years, and up to 12 reports are stored.
Go to **Logs **> **Private Applications **> **Usage** > **Quarterly Business Reports** to view a list of downloadable quarterly business reports based on your organization's private application usage.
Each report provides the following information:
