[Bandwidth classes](/unified/about-bandwidth-classes) identify the [URL categories](/unified/about-url-categories) and [cloud applications](/unified/about-cloud-app-control) to which the service allocates bandwidth. You can group URL categories or applications into bandwidth classes, and then reference them in [Bandwidth Control](/unified/about-bandwidth-control) policy rules.
From the **Large Files** tab, you can choose the minimum file size for this bandwidth class. The service enforces bandwidth throttling when users attempt to download or upload files that are equal to or greater than the size specified.
To specify the minimum file size:
- Go to **Infrastructure **>** Internet & SaaS **>** Network Policies **>** Bandwidth Classes **to [manage bandwidth classes](/unified/adding-bandwidth-classes).
- Go to the **Large Files** tab.
- Select a minimum file size from the drop-down menu.
- Click **Save **and activate the changes.
