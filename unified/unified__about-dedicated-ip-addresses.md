To enable the Dedicated IP feature for your tenant, contact your Zscaler Account team.
The IP Addresses page displays the IP addresses that are dedicated to your organization provisioned by Zscaler. Zscaler provisions these IP addresses for the data centers the organization chooses. You can use the IP address dedicated to your tenant as the source IP address that egress through the Zscaler cloud.
The IP Addresses page provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View and download the IP addresses that are dedicated to your organization and use them as source IP addresses for applications that require a known source IP address for their traffic.
- Use the dedicated IP addresses to create gateways to forward traffic to the destinations that require the organization's unique source IP address without bypassing the Zscaler service, minimizing the risk of a security gap.
