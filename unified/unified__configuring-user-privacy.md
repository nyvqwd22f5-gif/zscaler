User privacy policies protect your users from having their personally identifiable information (PII) and device information viewable by administrators within your organization.
You can configure these user privacy policies during onboarding, or later at any time in the Admin Portal:
- **Collect device owner information and traffic**: When this setting is enabled, administrators in your organization are able to view user device information (i.e., device hostname, device owner, and device name) when they view dashboards, reports, or insights. This setting is enabled by default; it should be disabled where required by law, such as regions governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Click the toggle to disable this feature.
- **Turn off automatic crash reporting**: When this setting is enabled, Zscaler will upload reports of system crashes experienced by your users for analysis. These reports might contain user identifiable information. This setting is disabled by default in compliance with GDPR. Click the toggle to enable this feature.
Click **Next** when you are done reviewing the policies to [configure blocked countries](/unified/configuring-blocked-countries) and [customize user notifications](/unified/customizing-user-notifications).
