The Mobile App Store Control policy protects users from inadvertently downloading mobile apps from unauthorized or risky app stores. You can define a Mobile App Store Control policy to restrict the app stores from which users are prevented from downloading mobile apps to their mobile devices. When an app store is listed in the policy, users can browse the restricted app stores, but are blocked from downloading apps from those stores. Restricting users to using only official or approved app stores reduces the likelihood that users can download apps from sites that might contain vulnerabilities or that are fake copies of well-known apps.
The Mobile App Store Control provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Define policies to protect users from downloading malicious or unauthorized apps.
- View and modify all existing app store policies, including Zscaler's recommended policies.
- Restrict users to only be able to download apps from official app stores.
When no policy is configured, the default action is to *allow* app downloads from all app stores.
You can define a list of blocked app stores. Users can browse the app stores in the list, but they are blocked from downloading apps from the app stores.
If your organization has the Mobile Security subscription, you can also define a policy to prevent users from downloading malicious apps. To learn more, see [Understanding Mobile Malware Protection.](/unified/understanding-mobile-malware-protection)
