The Linked Services page shows your subscribed Zscaler service tenants. If a tenant is unlinked, the users under that tenant can't access the Admin Portal.
Service linking provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Individually view your organization level access to the Admin Portal via the ZIdentity service.
- Get a clear idea of ZIdentity enablement status for your organization.
