Zscaler's cloud application tag allows you to logically group cloud applications based on your organization's requirements. This provides access control for specific cloud applications belonging to custom and/or predefined categories.
This feature consists of three parts: creating a cloud application tag, associating the tag with the cloud application, and creating risk profiles with this tag. To learn more about associating a tag with a cloud application, see [About Cloud Applications](/unified/about-cloud-applications) and [About Application Information](/unified/about-application-information).
Cloud application tags provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Group cloud applications (i.e., custom and/or predefined applications) from different categories based on your organization's requirements.
- Create cloud application risk profiles based on cloud application tags.
- Handle traffic to specific cloud applications by applying cloud app control policies with tag-based risk profiles.
