A classification is a way to categorize apps in the App Inventory. You can assign one of the following classifications to an app:
- **Unclassified**: The app does not have a specific classification. This is the default state of any new application.
- **Sanctioned**: The app is sanctioned for use.
- **Reviewing**: The app is under investigation.
- **Unsanctioned**: The app is not sanctioned for use.
You can view and edit the classification in the App Inventory or the [App Panel](/unified/about-app-panel) header.
- [Classify an App in the App Inventory](#classify-app-inventory)
- [Classify an App in the App Panel Header](#classify-app-panel)
The classification remains assigned to the app throughout its lifecycle (e.g., if you [revoke the app](/unified/revoking-and-banning-apps), and then a user re-installs it.) The classification remains the same unless an administrator changes it, which is [recorded as an activity](/unified/about-app-panel#app-panel-activities).
You can also automatically assign a classification to apps that meet the criteria of a policy. To learn more, see[ 3rd-Party App Governance Policies](/unified/3rd-party-app-governance-policies).
[]To classify an app:
- In the left-side navigation, go to **Inventory**.
- In the App Inventory, go to the **Classification** column.
-
In the drop-down menu, select the appropriate classification for the app.
