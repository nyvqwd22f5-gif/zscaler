Predefined applications are made with readily available data in the Digital Experience Monitoring service to allow fast and seamless configuration. To learn more, see [About Applications](/unified/about-applications-0).
To configure a predefined application:
- Go to **Policies > Configuration** > **Applications.**
- Choose an application from the [Predefined Applications list](/unified/predefined-applications-digital-experience-monitoring). Click the arrow next to the application's name. Depending on the application, either click **Go **or enter your tenant ID information.
The **Status** column shows that the application and its preconfigured web and cloud path probes have been **Enabled**. The **Status **for predefined applications that are not yet fully activated appears as **Pending Onboard** in the Predefined Applications list.

- Click **Save** and activate your changes.
