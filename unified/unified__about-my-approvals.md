If an admin has enabled privileged requests and approvals for the Privileged Remote Access (PRA) Portal, a user can access the My Requests and My Approvals pages within the portal. If a user has the My Approvals feature enabled, they can click on the My Approvals icon on the PRA Portal page to manage privileged requests and approvals on the My Requests and My Approvals tabs. The admin must also [configure a portals policy](/unified/configuring-portals-policies) to enable requesting and reviewing approvals. The My Requests page displays the privileged approval requests that you, as a user, have created. The My Approvals page displays privileged approval requests you have permission to approve and reject. You can view the analytics of the privileged approval requests on the [Requests page](/unified/accessing-privileged-requests).
My Approvals provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Create and manage privileged approval requests from the PRA Portal.
- View the status of privileged approval requests.
