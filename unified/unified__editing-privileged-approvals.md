To edit a privileged approval:
- Go to **Policies > Clientless **> **Privileged Approvals**.
- In the table, locate the privileged approval you want to modify and click the **Edit** icon.
Privileged approvals with an Expired approval status cannot be edited. Only privileged approvals with Active and Future approval statuses include the edit icon.
- In the **Edit Approval** window, modify fields as necessary. To learn more about each field, see [Configuring Privileged Approvals](/unified/configuring-privileged-approvals).
