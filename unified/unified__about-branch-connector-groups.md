Branch Connector groups represent a cluster of individual [Branch Connectors](/unified/about-branch-connectors) used to configure policy rules in the Admin Portal.
Branch Connector groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Apply policies to a group of Branch Connectors.
- Upgrade Branch Connectors belonging to a group to maintain redundancy while upgrades are being executed.
Branch Connector groups listed in the Admin Portal come from the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. You can create Branch Connector groups in the Admin Portal using the images shared for your hypervisor. To learn more, see Downloading Branch Connector Images and About Branch Connector Groups in the Zscaler Cloud Connector Help Portal.
