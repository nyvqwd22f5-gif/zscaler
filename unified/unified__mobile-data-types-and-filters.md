There are two ways you work with mobile data types and filters to define the mobile traffic information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/unified/about-widgets), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/unified/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/unified/about-dashboards) or [report](/unified/about-interactive-reports) and select Mobile in the Widget Settings dialog, you select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu. [See image.](#widget)
In the Logs > Insights > Internet & SaaS >** **Mobile Insights page, you select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu on the left pane. [See image.](#insights)

The user, department, and location filters list 200 results at a time. They provide search fields where you can type a few characters and the results narrow down to match your input until you find what you want.
Data Types and Filters
Certain filters, like** **Users, Departments, Locations, and others, support the selection of multiple values. For these, you can select up to 200 values in a single filter. You can also choose to include or exclude the selected values.
There are certain filter combinations that won't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs. For example, the Department and Location filters don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs when applied.
