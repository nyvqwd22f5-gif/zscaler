Zscaler records the login name and IP address of every user who changes configuration settings. Audit logs display the user's login and logout record (timestamps, actions, client IP, etc.), and the configuration changes they perform.
Audit Logs provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Monitor the changes made by the admins to configurations.
- Review configuration changes for comparison of the before-and-after administration sessions.
