To edit an client forwarding policy rule:
- Go to **Policy **> **Client Forwarding Policy**.
- Locate the client forwarding policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit icon**.
If you only want to change an client forwarding policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter in a new value on the [Client Forwarding Policy page](/zpa/about-client-forwarding-policy).
- In the **Edit Client Forwarding Policy **window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Client Forwarding Policies](/zpa/configuring-client-forwarding-policies).
