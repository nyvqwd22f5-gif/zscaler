Filters define the traffic information that you view in your Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Insights Logs. To learn more about logs, see [About Insights Logs](/unified/about-insights-logs).
Certain filters, like** **User, Department, and others, support the selection of multiple values. You can select up to 200 values in a single filter. You can also choose to include or exclude the selected values. Some filters support additional operators (i.e., Contains, Starts With, Ends With, Exact Match, Does Not Contain, Does Not End With, Does Not Start With, Not Null, or Is Null) for filters that perform string matches.
