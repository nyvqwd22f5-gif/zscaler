Zscaler’s role-based administration enables you to assign ZIdentity users or user groups with admin roles and permissions and control their level of access to the Admin Portal.
There are two predefined admin roles:
- Super Admin: System role with full permissions.
- View Only Admin: System role view only permissions.
You cannot delete the predefined roles.
Ensure that you have [added users](/unified/adding-users-0) and [user groups](/unified/adding-user-groups) to the Admin Portal before assigning necessary admin roles.
Role management provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Assign users and user groups as admins to manage tasks in the Admin Portal.
- View all the configured admins, their access levels, and functional scope.
