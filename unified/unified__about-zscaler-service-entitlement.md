Zscaler Client Connector provides users access to Internet & SaaS, Private Applications, Digital Experience Monitoring, and Zscaler Deception services. Zscaler Service Entitlement allows you to select which group of users or device groups can enroll into the Private Applications, Digital Experience Monitoring, or Zscaler Deception services. By default, Internet & SaaS enrollment is always enabled for all users.
On the Zscaler Service Entitlement page, you can configure selective entitlement to:
- [Enable Private Applications for only a select group of users](/unified/enabling-private-applications-group-users).
- [Configure Private Applications machine tunnel for all devices](/unified/configuring-private-applications-machine-tunnel-all).
- [Enable Digital Experience Monitoring for a select group of users](/unified/enabling-digital-experience-monitoring-group-users).
