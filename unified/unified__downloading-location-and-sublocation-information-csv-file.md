To download a CSV file of locations and sublocations:
- Go to **Infrastructure **>** Internet & SaaS **>** Traffic Forwarding **>** Location Management**.
-
Click **Download CSV**.
- You can download only one file per hour. To learn more, see [Ranges & Limitations](/unified/ranges-limitations).
- If you have thousands of locations, then it takes more time to download all the available locations.
- **Save **the file.
The CSV file you download here cannot be used to [import location and sublocation modifications](/unified/importing-location-and-sub-location-information-csv-file) because it uses a different format. If you need to import a CSV file to make modifications to locations, be sure to use the same format as the **Sample Import CSV file** provided by Zscaler.
