The Administrative Entitlements page shows the list of Zscaler services that your organization is subscribed to. You can assign ZIdentity users as service admins to these Zscaler services and with a role that is created in the respective Zscaler service. Admins can view only the assigned services on their respective ZIdentity Landing Page. To learn more, see [Managing Entitlements](/zidentity/managing-entitlements).
