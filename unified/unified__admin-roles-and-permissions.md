ZIdentity provides a set of predefined roles and permissions that you can assign to users and groups. As an admin, you can control what objects and services users are entitled to access on the subscribed Zscaler services.
You can assign a single or multiple roles to users. When a user is assigned multiple roles, the permission levels are hierarchical and the effective level of each permission is the highest from the user’s set of roles. For example, if a user has two roles, and one role has an External Identities permission of Restrictive View and the other has an External Identities permission of View, the effective permission level is View.
