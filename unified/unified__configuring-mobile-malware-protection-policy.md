The Mobile Malware Protection policy allows you to block users from downloading apps that are potentially malicious or that can cause data leakage. To learn more, see [Understanding Mobile Malware Protection](/unified/understanding-mobile-malware-protection).
The default Mobile Malware Protection policy blocks all categories. To learn more, see [Recommended Mobile Malware Protection Policy](/unified/recommended-mobile-malware-protection-policy).
To configure the Mobile Malware Protection policy:
- Go to **Policies **>** Cybersecurity **>** Inline Security **>** Mobile Malware Protection**.

- Performing device or personal information collection and harvesting (e.g., phone number, SMS messages, email address, or location coordinates)

- Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)

- **Unencrypted User Credentials**: Blocks an application from leaking a user's credentials in an unencrypted format (e.g., a username and password sent in clear text).
- **Location Information**: Blocks an application from leaking device location details via communication in an unencrypted format or for an unknown purpose.
- **Personally Identifiable Information**: Blocks an application from leaking a user's personally identifiable information (PII) via communication in an unencrypted format or for an unknown purpose.
