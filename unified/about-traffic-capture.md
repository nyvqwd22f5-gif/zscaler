Zscaler allows you to capture network traffic which can be accessed later through PCAP files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by your organization. Currently, the following policies can be configured to capture traffic:
- Advanced Threat Protection
- File Type Control
- Firewall Filtering
- DNS Filtering
- IPS Control
- Malware Protection
- URL Filtering
Traffic Capture provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Save time and effort by integrating Traffic Capture directly into Internet & SaaS policies.
- Reduce the storage footprint of captured traffic data with granular control over the type of traffic captured at the policy level.
- Keep capture data secure and limited to those who have the necessary administrative privileges.
