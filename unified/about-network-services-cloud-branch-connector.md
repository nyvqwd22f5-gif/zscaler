Zscaler firewall has over 50 predefined services and an admin can configure up to 1,024 additional custom services. You can add, modify, or delete ports in all predefined services except ICMP_any, UDP_any, TCP_any, and OTHER. To learn more, see [Configuring Network Services](/unified/configuring-network-services-cloud-branch-connector).

Network services configured in Zscaler are identified at the first packet, leading to immediate policy action. In contrast, multiple packets are typically required by deep packet inspection to identify network applications before a policy action can take place. Therefore, Zscaler recommends that you rank firewall filtering rules for network services higher than rules for network applications to prevent packets from being allowed unnecessarily from traffic that would otherwise be blocked by rules using first-packet identification.
You can also define network service groups. To learn more, see [About Network Service Groups](/unified/about-network-service-groups-0)[.](/zia/about-network-service-groups)
Network Services provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create policies based on TCP and UDP source and destination ports.
- Update predefined network services for your purposes.
- Use the same network services in forwarding & security policies.

- [Add a network service](/unified/configuring-network-services-cloud-branch-connector).
- View a list of all network services. For each service, you can view:
- **Name**: The name of the application service layer you are controlling.
- **TCP Source Ports**: The TCP source port number or port number range, if any, that is used by the network service.
- **TCP Destination Ports**: The TCP destination port number or port number range, if any, that is used by the network service.
- **UDP Source Ports**: The UDP source port number or port number range, if any, that is used by the network service.
- **UDP Destination Ports**: The UDP destination port number or port number range, if any, that is used by the network service.
- **Description**: For predefined services, a brief description of what the service is. For services you have added, any additional notes you included.
- Edit a network service.
- View a network service.
- Modify the table and its columns.
