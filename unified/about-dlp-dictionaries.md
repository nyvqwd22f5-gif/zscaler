A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) dictionary contains a set of patented algorithms that are designed to detect specific kinds of information in your users' traffic and activities. The Zscaler service provides predefined dictionaries that you can modify and, in some cases, clone. You can also create custom dictionaries for content not covered by predefined dictionaries. For example, you can create custom dictionaries that trigger based on specific patterns and phrases, or trigger based on exact data matching. To learn more, see [Editing Predefined DLP Dictionaries](/zia/editing-predefined-dlp-dictionaries), [Adding Custom DLP Dictionaries](/zia/adding-custom-dlp-dictionary), and [Cloning Predefined DLP Dictionaries](/zia/cloning-predefined-dlp-dictionaries).
DLP dictionaries provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Use a set of patented algorithms to detect specific kinds of information in user traffic and activities.
- Use Zscaler's predefined dictionaries that you can modify or clone.
- Create your own custom dictionaries.
Any combination of cloned, predefined, and custom dictionaries can be added to a DLP engine, which is what you must reference when creating DLP policies. To learn more, see [About DLP Engines](/zia/about-dlp-engines).
