In the Admin Portal, some of the data is organized and displayed in tables. You can modify the default settings for each table. Every time you make a change, the settings are stored in your browser's local storage so that your changes are preserved the next time you log on. If you clear your cache or use a different browser, your settings are lost.
Not all settings are available for all tables.
You can do the following:
- [Expand data in the table](#expand)
- [Filter data in the table](#filter)
- [Hide columns](#hide)
- [Reorder columns](#reorder)
- [Reset table to default settings](#reset)
- [Resize columns](#resize)
- [Search tables](#search)
- [Sort the column data](#sort)
[]Some tables have rows that can expand to show more detail. Click the Expand icon in the first column within a table to expand it. To expand all rows in a table, click **Expand All**. After a row is expanded, additional details are provided. After a row is expanded, you can view or edit a resource.
To view or edit a resource, click the name of the resource within the expanded row of the table to view or edit the resource. The **View** or **Edit** window appears.
[]Some tables let you filter the information shown. To filter the data in the table, click on a filter (e.g., **Name**, **Created By**), select or enter a selection, and then click **Apply.**

You can also click **Clear** to clear your selections, click **Hide Filters** to hide your filters, click **Reset** to reset the applied filters after applying them, or save applied filters after applying them.
To save your filter preferences:
-
Click the **Menu** icon (![zpa-menu-icon.png](/downloads/zpa/getting-started/admin-portal/using-tables/zpa-menu-icon.png)
), and then click **Save Applied Filter**.
The **Save Applied Filter **window appears.
-
In the **Save Applied Filter **window, enter a name for the applied filter, and then click **Save**.

After filters are saved to your preferences, you can toggle between the applied filters by clicking the name of the filter next to **Hide Filters**, or you can delete a saved filter by clicking the **Delete **icon (![zpa-delete-icon.png](/downloads/zpa/getting-started/admin-portal/using-tables/zpa-delete-icon.png)
).
![Selecting predefined filters](/downloads/zpa/getting-started/admin-portal/using-tables/zpa-selecting-predefined-filters.png)
For the applied filters that are saved to your preferences, you can apply additional filters. To save or discard the additional changes made to the applied filters, click the **Menu** icon, and then click **Discard Changes** or **Save Changes**.

After you make changes to an applied filter, an **Information **icon (![zpa-information-icon.png](/downloads/zpa/getting-started/admin-portal/using-tables/zpa-information-icon.png)
) appears next to the filter name to indicate unsaved changes. You must click the **Menu **icon > **Save Changes** to save changes to the predefined filter that is currently selected.
[]When you do not need to view all the columns at once, some tables allow you to hide them so only the columns you want to view are visible.
To hide a column, hover over the **Column Menu** icon on the top right of the table and uncheck the column names you wish to hide. After you click on the checkbox, the table refreshes and displays only the checked columns.
For tables under the **Policy** and **Administration **pages, you must have at least one column visible at all times. For **Insight log** tables, you can **Deselect All** columns and render the table empty.

[]You can reorder columns in many tables. When available, this is done in one of 2 ways:
- [From the Table](#from-table)
- [From the Column Menu settings](#from-column-menu-settings)
[]When you hover over a column header in the table, a **Move** cursor appears. To reorder, drag and drop the column to the desired location. An arrow indicates where the column will end up after the drop.
After you have dragged the column to the desired location, the table refreshes and displays data in the new column order.
The column menu settings also change to reflect the new order.

[]When you hover over a listed column name in the settings, a **Move** cursor appears. Drag and drop the column to the desired position. After you drop the column name, the table refreshes and displays the data in the new column order.

[]When you make changes to the columns, you can revert back to the default settings by hovering over the **Column Menu** and clicking on the **Reset** icon.
This will not reset your sort order.

[]When the data in a column takes up more space than the viewing area allows, it gets clipped. You can view the clipped data in the tooltip. For many tables, you can also increase the column width.
To increase the column width, hover over the right border of the column. A resize icon appears. Drag and drop to the desired column width.

[]You can use the search bar to filter data in some tables. The table displays the rows containing your search term.
The search results displays the search term even if it is in a hidden column.
[]When you hover over different column headers, you will see that some columns have an arrow icon next to them. These arrows indicate that you can sort the data in those columns. You can sort data in ascending or descending order.
To sort a column, click on the arrow in the table column header.
