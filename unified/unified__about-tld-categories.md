Top-level domain (TLD) categories are [URL categories](/unified/about-url-categories) that give you the ability to group together TLDs for use in the following policies:
- [DNS Control](/unified/configuring-dns-control-policy)
- [File Type Control](/unified/configuring-file-type-control-policy)
- [Firewall Filtering](/unified/configuring-firewall-filtering-policy)
- [IPS Control](/unified/configuring-ips-control-policy)
- [Sandbox](/unified/configuring-sandbox-policy)
- [DLP Policy with Content Inspection](/unified/configuring-dlp-policy-rules-content-inspection)
- [DLP Policy without Content Inspection](/unified/configuring-dlp-policy-rules-without-content-inspection)
- [Forwarding Control](/unified/configuring-forwarding-policy)
- [SSL Inspection](/unified/configuring-ssl-inspection-policy)
- [URL Filtering](/unified/about-url-filtering)
You can use TLD categories in policies to control access to domains for a specific country or to block access to TLDs that might be used solely for malicious purposes.
