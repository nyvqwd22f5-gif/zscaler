The HTTP header insertion profile allows you to add custom HTTP request headers and modify existing HTTP request headers. It consists of two parts: adding HTTP header insertion profiles and associating them to a URL Filtering policy rule.
The HTTP header insertion profile provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Create policies based on HTTP headers.
- Add custom HTTP request headers to the egressing traffic with the allow action configured.
On the HTTP Header Insertion Profile page (Policies > Access Control > Internet & SaaS > HTTP Header Control > HTTP Header Insertion Profile), you can do the following:
- [Add an HTTP header insertion profile.](/unified/adding-http-header-insertion-profile)
- Search for a configured HTTP header insertion profile.
- View a list of all the configured HTTP header insertion profiles. For each HTTP header insertion profile, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the HTTP header insertion profile that is displayed when configuring a policy rule.
- **HTTP Headers**: The HTTP headers (i.e., key-value pairs) that are added to the profile.
- **Description**: The description of the HTTP header insertion profile if available.
- Edit an HTTP header insertion profile.
- [Modify the table and its columns.](/unified/using-tables)
