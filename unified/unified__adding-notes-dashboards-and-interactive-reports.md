You can add notes to [dashboards](/unified/about-dashboards) and [interactive reports](/unified/about-interactive-reports) (both standard and [custom reports](/unified/creating-or-copying-report)) for a variety of annotation purposes.
You can place notes anywhere on the screen so that they pertain to just one item or to multiple items in dashboards or in reports. You can add up to 7 notes per dashboard or report, and each note can contain up to 256 characters.

All admins can add notes or modify notes created by other admins, as long as the admin’s [role](/unified/adding-admin-roles) has full permission to Dashboard Access and Reporting Access. Once posted, the notes automatically display the name of the admin who added or most recently modified the note, as well as the date and time the note was added or last modified.
When you add notes to a dashboard, the notes become attached to that specific dashboard, but not to a specific iteration of that dashboard. For example, if you add notes to the Web Overview dashboard, those notes will not appear in another dashboard (e.g., the Security or Web Browsing dashboard). However, if you modify the Web Overview dashboard after adding notes to it (e.g., if you edit the widgets in the dashboard or if you change the time frame), the notes will still appear in the same place.
The notes function in a similar way for** **interactive reports. The notes you create are attached to a specific report, but not to a specific iteration of the report. For example, if you add notes to the Company Summary Report, those notes do not appear in any other report. However, if you change the time frame of that Company Summary Report (e.g., from Current Day to Current Week), the notes will still appear in the same place.
