In Application Bypass, you can view the available predefined IP-based applications and add IP-based applications to bypass traffic. You can also add process-based applications to bypass traffic. Select applications to bypass traffic in [App Profiles](/unified/configuring-zscaler-client-connector-app-profiles) under Traffic Steering.
You cannot configure domain-based bypasses on this page. If you want to bypass a specific domain, you can add it to a custom PAC file. To learn more, see [Best Practices for Using PAC Files with Zscaler Client Connector](/unified/best-practices-using-pac-files-zscaler-client-connector).
Application bypass provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View, add, and search for IP-based or process-based applications to bypass traffic.
- Explore details of a bypassed application.
