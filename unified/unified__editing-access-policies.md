To edit an access policy rule:
- Go to the **Access Policy** page (Policies > Access Control > Private Applications > Access Policy).
- Locate the access policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit **icon.
If you only want to change an access policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter a new value on the [Access Policy page](/unified/about-access-policy).
-
In the **Edit Access Policy **window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Access Policies](/unified/about-access-policy).
