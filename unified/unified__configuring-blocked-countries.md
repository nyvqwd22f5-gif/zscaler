You can block internet traffic to and from web servers based in specific countries.
To block countries, on the Miscellaneous page, review the list of Zscaler-recommended blocked countries under **Block Countries**.
- To add another blocked country, click the **Add **icon and search for the country you want to block.
- To remove a blocked country, click the **Close **icon within the country you want to remove from the blocked list.
You can review the list of blocked countries later in the Admin Portal.
When you are done setting up blocked countries, you can [add your company logo to banners, emails, and user notifications sent from Zscaler](/unified/adding-your-company-logo) on the bottom of the Miscellaneous page.
