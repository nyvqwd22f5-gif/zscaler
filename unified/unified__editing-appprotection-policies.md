To edit an AppProtection policy:
- Go to **Policies **>** Cybersecurity **>** Inline Security **>** Protection Policies**.
- In the table, locate the policy you want to modify and click the **Edit **icon.
The **Edit AppProtection Rule** window appears.

If you only want to change an AppProtection policy rule's place in the Rule Order, you can manually enter in a new value on the [AppProtection Policy page](/zpa/about-inspection-policy).
- In the **Edit AppProtection Rule** window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring AppProtection Policies](/zpa/configuring-inspection-policies).
If you edit application segments that have Active Directory Inspection enabled, then a warning appears to notify you that the application segments and segment groups are inspected for Active Directory Protection traffic.
- Click **Save**.
