The Executive Insights App admin [role](/unified/adding-admin-roles) is one of the default roles Zscaler provides. It gives the admin the permissions and scope required to access the Executive Insights App, but not the Admin Portal. If you want to give an admin other permissions and functional scopes in the Admin Portal along with access to the Executive Insights App, you can create an [admin role](/unified/adding-admin-roles) with **Executive Insights App Access** enabled, and then assign the new role to the admin.
To edit the Executive Insights App role:
- Go to **Administration** > **Admin Management **> **Role Based Access Control** > **Internet & SaaS**.
-
On the **Role Management** page, click the **Edit** icon for the **Executive Insights App** role.
The **Edit Administrator Role** window appears.
-
In the **Edit Administrator Role** window:
- **Name**: The name of the admin role.
- **Enable Permissions for Executive Insights App**: Gives the admin assigned this role the permissions and scope required to access the Executive Insights App. You can't modify this field.
- **User Names**: Choose whether real user names are visible to admins with this role when they view data in the Executive Insights App.
- **Visible**: User names are visible.
- **Obfuscated**: User names are obscured.
