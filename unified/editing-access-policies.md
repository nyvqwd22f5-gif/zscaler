To edit an access policy rule:
- Go to **Policy **> **Access Policy**.
- Locate the access policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit **icon.
If you only want to change an access policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter a new value on the [Access Policy page](/zpa/about-accesspolicy).
-
In the **Edit Access Policy **window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Access Policies](/zpa/about-accesspolicy/new).
Extranet Resource options only appear in this window if the Extranet feature is enabled in your organization.
