If your users encounter an issue when attempting to access a Browser Access enabled application, the end user notification (EUN) includes the error code. For example:
![ZPA End User Notification (EUN) showing Browser Access-related error code](/downloads/zpa/documentation-knowledgebase/browser-access/understanding-browser-access-error-codes/zpa-browseraccess-eunmsg.png)
The EUN heading (e.g., ZPA BA: Proxy loop detected) is a hyperlink which leads your users to the Zscaler Help Portal for more information and the HTTP status code is always displayed. This information also appears in the diagnostics. To learn more, see [Private Applications](/unified/analytics/private-applications).
