The Default banner theme is automatically applied to all the isolation profiles in your organization, unless you edit a specific profile to have a different banner theme. You cannot delete the Default banner theme, but you can edit it or edit an existing theme.
To edit a banner theme:
- Go to **Policies** > **Access Control **> **Clientless **> **Banners**.
- Click the **Edit** button next to the banner theme you want to edit.
The **Edit Isolation Banner** window appears.
- In the **Edit Isolation Banner** window, modify the fields as necessary. To learn more about each field, see [Adding a Banner Theme for the Isolation End User Notification in Private Applications](/unified/adding-banner-theme-isolation-end-user-notification-private-applications).
