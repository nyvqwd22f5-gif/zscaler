Each [Network Connector](/unified/about-network-connectors) is mapped to one Network Connector group. A [Network segment](/unified/about-network-segments) is then mapped to a Network Connector group for traffic forwarding. Ensure that your Network Connector is up and running for the Network Connector group to be active.
Network Connector groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Access to the destination networks in the Network segment policy.
- Enables you to add a Network Connector to a group.
