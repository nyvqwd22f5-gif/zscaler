Webhook configuration in the Admin Portal allows you to deliver alerts for the configured events in the alert rule to third-party applications (e.g., ServiceNow, Splunk, etc.) for incident management.
The webhook configuration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Send event data for incident management.
- Associate the webhook to a specific alert rule to receive email notifications when the alert is triggered.
