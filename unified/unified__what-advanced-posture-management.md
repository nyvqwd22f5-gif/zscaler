Zscaler Advanced SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) is a comprehensive and unified solution that delivers complete security across Software as a Service (SaaS) apps and platforms, from data visibility to posture and governance. It helps you to quickly identify and mitigate risky misconfigurations, control SaaS sprawl and reduce third-party access, and identify users at risk.
With Advanced SSPM, you can continuously monitor and correct SaaS security posture to ensure regulatory compliance is maintained across the organization. Advanced SSPM lets you reduce your attack surface by vetting third-party integrations and revoking risky connections. You can also ensure least-privileged SaaS access and revoke overprivileged identities and permissions.
If you subscribe to the Advanced SSPM service, you can access Advanced SSPM from the Admin Portal using single sign-on (SSO).
