Each ZIdentity user can be assigned to different [service entitlements](/unified/about-service-entitlements) and [administrative entitlements](/unified/about-administrative-entitlements) depending on the role. You can also view the multi-factor authenticators that are configured for the user. You need to first add users, assign them to the subscribed Zscaler services and then access the [Users page](/unified/about-users-0) to view the entitlements.
