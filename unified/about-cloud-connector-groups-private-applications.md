Cloud Connector groups are comprised of individual Cloud Connectors and are used to configure policy rules in the Admin Portal.
Cloud Connector groups provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Apply policies to a group of deployed Cloud Connectors.
- Upgrade Cloud Connectors belonging to a group to maintain redundancy while upgrades are being executed.
Cloud Connector groups listed in the Admin Portal come from the Admin Portal. You can create and update Cloud Connector groups in the Admin Portal.
