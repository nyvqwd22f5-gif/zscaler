Application Segment Import is a feature in Private Applications that allows users to bulk import those database files for faster [application segment](/unified/policies/private-applications/access-control/application-segments) configuration for new and existing users. Users can apply their existing curated [application](/unified/about-applications) data without having to manually add granular details, thus simplifying the overall application segment configuration process. This creates an easy starting point for organizations to begin using the Zero Trust framework, and provides an easier way to change the data for evolving application segments.
Application Segment Import provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Use existing application data for application segment configuration.
- Configure application segments more quickly.
- Easily update the data for an application segment if it changes.
