Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices enable Zero Trust connectivity everywhere for all unauthenticated users, servers, or IoT/OT, regardless of location. To learn more, see Understanding Zero Trust Branch Devices.
In Experience Center, Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices might be called Branch Connectors, appliances, or Edge Connectors.
Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Eliminate the attack surface by connecting branches and data centers through the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) independent of the underlying WAN transport network.
- Prevent lateral threat movement, allowing Zero Trust connectivity to build a foundation for secure connectivity that enables east-to-west segmentation.
- (Physical devices) Explore plug-and-play deployment, allowing Zero Trust provisioning to simplify deployment and reduce the time to integrate.
- (Virtual devices) Ease deployment on any server running VMware, Linux KVM, or Microsoft Hyper-V.
