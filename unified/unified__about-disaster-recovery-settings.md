After you have enabled disaster recovery application segments, Private Service Edges, and App Connector Groups, you can set up the authentication validation window for Disaster Recovery Mode, enter the DNS name, and upload the DNS Public Key. To learn more, see [Understanding Disaster Recovery](/unified/understanding-disaster-recovery).
Disaster recovery settings provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster scenario that impacts the global Zscaler cloud infrastructure.
- Provide users with access to critical applications, App Connectors, and Private Service Edges during a disaster scenario.
About the Disaster Recovery Settings Page
On the Disaster Recovery Settings page (Infrastructure > Private Access > Business Continuity > Disaster Recovery), you can do the following:
- View and manage the disaster recovery settings.
- Go to the [Disaster Recovery Application Segments](/unified/about-disaster-recovery-application-segments) page to view the application segments designated for disaster recovery.
- Go to the [Disaster Recovery Private Service Edge Groups](/unified/about-disaster-recovery-private-service-edge-groups) page to view the Private Service Edge groups designated for disaster recovery.
- Go to the [Disaster Recovery App Connector Groups](/unified/about-disaster-recovery-app-connector-groups) page to view the App Connector Groups designated for disaster recovery.
- Download the [Zscaler DNS Record Generator](/zpa/understanding-and-installing-zscaler-dns-record-generator). The Zscaler DNS Record Generator creates the DNS TXT records and the private and public keys used to verify the activation of Disaster Recovery Mode.

Configuring Disaster Recovery Settings
To configure Disaster Recovery Settings:
- Go to the **Settings **tab.
- Complete the following fields:
-
**Max Age for Authentication**: Review your timeout policy and add the maximum timeout with the desired length you want disaster recovery to be set for. Then enter the amount in days, weeks, or months. This is the set amount of time that the current end user authentication is valid for during Disaster Recovery Mode. The default maximum age for authentication is 14 days. The maximum age for authentication value is extended starting from the time the user authenticated. This value is not added to the end of the authentication period or after the SAML token has expired. For example, the user authenticates on August 1 at 12:00 AM with the **Authentication Timeout** value set to 20 days in their timeout policy, and then sets the **Max Age for Authentication** value to 14 days. If the user enters Disaster Recovery Mode on August 10, then authentication is extended up to August 15 at 12:00 AM.
Zscaler recommends configuring the **Max Age for Authentication** value to be greater than or equal to the Authentication Timeout value of your[ timeout policy](/unified/configuring-timeout-policies).
- **Disaster Recovery Public Key**: Upload a public key generated by the DNS Record Generator. The DNS Record Generator creates both signed and unsigned public and private keys, but you only need to upload the public key. This public key verifies that the DNS name is signed with the selected private key. The public key is only applicable if you are signing the DNS TXT records. To learn more, see [Creating DNS TXT Records](/unified/creating-dns-txt-records). You can also delete the public key by clicking the **Delete** icon (![Delete icon in the Disaster Recovery Settings page](/downloads/zpa/administration/about-disaster-recovery-settings/trash%20icon.png)
) or download it by clicking the **Download** icon (![Download icon in the Disaster Recovery Settings page](/downloads/zpa/administration/about-disaster-recovery-settings/download%20icon.png)
).
Zscaler provides the DNS Record Generator to help you create the file for you to upload for your DNS public and private keys. To learn more, see [Understanding and Installing the Zscaler DNS Record Generator](/unified/understanding-and-installing-zscaler-dns-record-generator).
- **Disaster Recovery Domain Name**: Enter an administrator-controlled valid domain name or a subdomain (e.g., `zpadr.zscaler.com`) that is used to trigger or exit Disaster Recovery Mode. The disaster recovery domain name hosts these two types of DNS record names: the TXT record name and the A record name. Disaster recovery is triggered or exited through the TXT record. Ensure you enter all of the IP addresses of the disaster recovery-enabled Private Service Edges into the A records under the disaster recovery domain or subdomain you created (e.g., the domain `zpadr.zscaler.com` can have four A records corresponding to each of the disaster recovery-enabled Private Service Edges). This domain name is also used by Zscaler Client Connector to connect to the Private Service Edge for Disaster Recovery Mode, based on the A records included in the DNS response.
- Click **Save**.
