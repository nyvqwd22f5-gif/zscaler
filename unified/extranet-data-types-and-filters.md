There are two ways you work with Extranet data types and filters to define extranet traffic information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/zia/what-widget), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports) and select Extranet in the Widget Settings dialog, you can select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu.

In the Analytics >** **Extranet Insights page, you select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu on the left pane.

Certain filters, like** **Users, Departments, Locations, and others, support the selection of multiple values. For these, you can select up to 200 values in a single filter. You can also choose to include or exclude the selected values.
There are certain filter combinations that don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs. For example, the Department and Location filters don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs when applied.
