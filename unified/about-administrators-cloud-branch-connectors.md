Zscaler's role-based administration enables you to control what different admins can do in the Zscaler Admin Portal.
Role-based administrators provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View and navigate your organization's admins.
- Delegate responsibilities to your organization's admins.
- Granularly control access to the portal to ensure that policies and settings do not conflict.
To facilitate role-based administration, each admin account comprises a role and scope:
- An admin role or partner admin role allows you to specify which features admins can access in the portal.
- An admin scope allows you to specify the areas of the organization (e.g., departments or locations) for which admins can configure policies or settings in the portal.
You can configure role-based administration using role and scope. For example, you can give your organization's CISO the ability to set only security policies in the Admin Portal (specified through role), but enable the CISO to set security policies for the entire organization (specified through scope). Similarly, you could give the Marketing Director the ability to set access policies relevant to productivity and compliance (specified through role), but allow them to do so only for a specific location or department (specified through scope).
Zscaler provides a default admin account that has full access to the Admin Portal and scope over the entire organization. You cannot edit or delete this account. With role-based administration, you can add as many additional admins as necessary to meet the specific needs of your organization. You can also edit and delete admins as necessary at any time.
