Once a Private Service Edge is scheduled for an update you can't [change the periodic software update](/unified/scheduling-periodic-software-updates-private-service-edge-group) time for that particular Private Service Edge. However, you can update the Private Service Edge's software manually.
To manually update software for a Private Service Edge:
- Go to the **Private Service Edges** page (Infrastructure > Private Access > Components > Private Service Edges).
- In the table, locate the Private Service Edge you want to update.
- In the **Update Status** column, verify that the status is **Scheduled**. If the status is not **Scheduled**, then you can not manually update the Private Service Edge.
- Click the **Update Now** icon.
