Diagnostics sessions can provide much more granular information to analyze any issues that your users might be facing. After a session is run, you can see the results by clicking the View icon in the session row.
Data for In Progress sessions is updated every minute. Completed Diagnostics sessions show complete session data. All other sessions show partial session data. If the session status is Expired, then no data is seen in the session report.
Each configured diagnostics session has a [version compatibility](/zdx/supported-versions-feature-compatibility#Diagnostics) that must be met to view the results.
Diagnostics Session Results
To view Diagnostics session results:
- Click the name of the session or the **View** icon in the **In Progress** or the **History** table. This displays the session information in the same tab.
- Click the **Open in a New Tab** icon to open session results in a new tab. You can use this feature to compare multiple session results.
You can then click the **Export PDF** button to export and save a PDF file of the session information.

Deep Tracing
Deep tracing provides an overview of a user, device, or application connecting to a network with the following:
- [General Diagnostic](#general)
- [Application](#type_application)
- [Device](#type_device)
The Diagnostics session results display information based on options chosen during configuration (e.g., application or device).
[See image.](#SessionResults)
[]
- **Name of the User**: The name and email address of the user.
- **Session Type**: The type of session selected during configuration.
- **Status**: This lists the status of the session. To learn more, see [Understanding the Diagnostics Status](/zdx/understanding-diagnostics-session-status).
- **Application**: The application the session was run on. If you did not choose an application, this field is empty.
- **Device**: The selected device. If you disabled **Device Probing**, nothing is listed. To learn more, see [Starting a New Diagnostics Session](/zdx/starting-new-diagnostics-session).
- **End time**: This shows the date and time the session ended.
[]
- **Web Probe Metrics**: This section shows data for the Page Fetch Time, Server Response Time, DNS Resolve Time, and Availability. The name of the probe is also listed in parentheses. If you had not selected a Web probe while configuring a session, this section is not displayed. The start and end times of the graphs align with the times for the Diagnostics session.
-
**Cloud Path**: This section displays a graph where you can choose to view either Latency or Packet Loss from the drop-down menu. It shows the Hop View and the Command Line View of the path taken by the probe. You can click the **Zoom** icon to view details of the Cloud Path till the probe reached its destination. If you did not select a Cloud Path probe while configuring a session, this section is not displayed. The Cloud Path also displays details such as tunnel information and differential latency. To learn more, see [Evaluating the Cloud Path](/zdx/evaluating-cloud-path).
If you select a point on a graph, a tooltip with the appropriate metric, the date and time are displayed in all the charts. If there is no data for two consecutive time points, a gap in the charts is displayed. An error message in the chart indicates the issue.
Network applications do not have a web front end, and therefore, Web Probe Metrics are not available. ZDX Scores are calculated using latency with only a single Cloud Path probe. To learn more, see [About Applications](/zdx/about-applications) and [Monitoring the Applications Overview](/zdx/monitoring-applications-overview).
[]
- **Device Health**: Displays graphs for CPU Usage, Wi-Fi Signal, Memory, Battery Level, Disk information, and Network information are displayed. Not all Device Health metrics are preselected; in the drop-down menu, you can select the elements you want to review. If you chose to disable the Device Probing while configuring the session, this section is not listed.
- **Top Processes**: Lists the top processes that are consuming resources by Memory Usage, CPU Usage, Disk Usage, and Network Usage, with the Process ID in parentheses. If the Device Probing option is not selected during configuration, this section is not listed.
- **User Device Events**: Shows the events for a device for the selected period of time. If the Device Probing option is disabled during configuration, this section is not listed.
Hi-Fi Cloud Path
A High Fidelity (Hi-Fi) Cloud path displays Cloud Path network connectivity or latency details where a Cloud Path sends a high number of packets.
Each Hi-Fi Cloud Path shows the following:
- [General Information](#hi-fi-general)
- [Overview](#hi-fi-overview)
- [Cloud Path](#hi-fi-cloud-path)
[See image.](#img_Hi-Fi-Results)
[]
- **Name of the User**: The name and email address of the user.
- **Session Type**: The type of session selected during configuration.
- **Status**: This lists the status of the session. To learn more, see [Understanding the Diagnostics Status](/zdx/understanding-diagnostics-session-status).
- **Device**: The selected device name.
[]
- Under **Data Center Details**:
- **Data Center Name**: The name of the Zscaler data center.
- **Location**: The location of the data center.
- **Proxy Hostname**: The proxy hostname of the Zscaler data center.
- **IP**: The IP address of the Zscaler data center.
- **Cloud Name**: The ZDX cloud name. To learn more, see [What Is My Cloud Name for ZDX?](/zdx/what-my-cloud-name-zdx)
- Under **User Details**:
- **User Name**: The name of the user.
- **Location**: The location of the user device.
- **IP**: The IP address of the user device.
- **ISP**: The internet service provider (ISP) the user device is connected to.
You can also view a map of where the impacted device and data center are. Click to zoom in or out with the map buttons or use your mouse scroll.

Bandwidth Test
A bandwidth test can provide information on a device's network connectivity or latency details.
Each bandwidth test displays the following:
- [General Information](#bandwidth-general)
- [Overview](#bandwidth-overview)
- [Results](#bandwidth-results)
- [Basic Diagnostics](#bandwidth-basic)
- [Cloud Path](#bandwidth-cloud)

[]Depending on how the device is connected to a network, there are different bandwidth results displayed.
- If the device is connected via Z-Tunnel 1.0 or Z-Tunnel 2.0, then the download and upload bandwidth speeds are displayed for those tunnels.
-
If the device is connected directly to the network with Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) and Generic Routing Ecapsulation (GRE) tunnels, then the Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) download and upload bandwidth speeds are displayed.
[See image.](#bandwidth_DNAT)
To capture DNAT information, the minimum required ZDX Module version is required. To learn more, see [Supported Versions & Feature Capability](/zdx/supported-versions-feature-compatibility#Diagnostics).
