This feature enables Admin Portal administrators to grant Zscaler Client Connector log file access to users who don’t have administrator privileges. This allows non-administrator users to send specific log files to admins instead of having to send the entire log folder in a ZIP file, making the troubleshooting process more efficient.
To allow non-admin users access to the Zscaler program data folder to access log files:
- In the Admin Portal, go to **Infrastructure > Connectors > Client > User Privacy**.
- On the **User Privacy** tab, select** Allow access to Client Connector logs folder for non-administrators**.
