If a user profile was recently deleted, that profile is displayed in the search results. Clicking the deleted user profile and accessing the user page also indicates that the profile is deleted.

The User/Devices Search page keeps a history of the last 5 users whose details you viewed. If a deleted user profile was part of the search history, that is also indicated.
