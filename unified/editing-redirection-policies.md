To edit a redirection policy rule:
- Go to **Policy **> **Redirection Policy**.
-
Locate the redirection policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit **icon. If you only want to change a redirection policy rule's place in the **Rule Order**, you can manually enter a new value on the [Redirection Policy](/zpa/about-redirection-policy) page.
Redirection policy rules that are managed by Zscaler are read only and cannot be edited or deleted.
The **Edit Redirection Policy** window appears.
- In the **Edit Redirection Policy** window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Redirection Policies](/zpa/configuring-redirection-policies).
