Email labels provide the option of adding response actions to Gmail and Microsoft Exhange clients based on the email content. Applying email labels creates categories in the users' email account automatically. These labels serve as indications to the users about the type of email content and the level of sensitivity.
Email labels provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Monitor the content that is being shared and accessed by the end users.
- Add labels to the emails based on the DLP and Malware scans to indicate the sensitivity and safety of the email content.
- Take corrective actions after the email label is created and secure the usage of the content.
With the [SaaS Security API Control Policy](/unified/policies/internet-saas/saas-security-posture-management/saas-security-api/saas-security-api-policies/saas-security-api-control), email tags can be applied to DLP or Malware policies where the email content is categorized as sensitive or unsafe attachments, respectively.
