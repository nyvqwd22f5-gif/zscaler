You can configure the browser end user notification (EUN) templates with custom block and custom caution messages. To display the EUNs on the browser when the [Cloud App Control Policy](/unified/about-cloud-app-control), [URL Filtering](/unified/about-url-filtering) rule, or [File Type Control](/unified/about-file-type-control) rule with block or caution action is triggered, you must reference one of the templates created here in the Cloud App Control Policy, URL Filtering rule, and File Type Control rule. To learn more, see [Configuring the URL Filtering Policy](/unified/configuring-url-filtering-policy), [Adding Rules to the Cloud App Control Policy](/unified/adding-rules-cloud-app-control-policy), and [Configuring the File Type Control Policy](/unified/configuring-file-type-control-policy).
Browser EUN templates provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Configure custom messages in addition to modifying default messages for the block and caution actions on a per policy rule basis.
- Associate the EUN templates with the Cloud App Control policy, URL Filtering rules, and File Type Control rule.
Zscaler browser EUNs come with default notification messages for each policy type, which can be customized. You can customize various elements of the notification, including the notification message for different policy actions, company name, logo, information displayed on the notification, duration of the notification, and more.
