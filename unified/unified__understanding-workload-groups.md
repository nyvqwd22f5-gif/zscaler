A workload group is a collection of resources deployed on the public cloud service provider, such as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform managed by an organization. A workload can be a virtual machine (VM) instance, serverless functions, and containers. It can be associated with user-defined tags and cloud service provider-generated attributes. These tags or attributes are key-value pairs. You can view the deployed workloads and their respective tags discovered in Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector.
You can define a workload group by building an expression using different tag types and key-value pairs in the Admin Portal. A workload group is used to logically group all the workloads with user-defined tags and cloud service provider-defined attributes that align with the tag expression of that workload group. The first line of each workload group expression is always defined by a tag type followed by suitable key-value pairs. While building an expression, you should ensure that the key-value pair used aligns with the tags and attributes defined for the workload on the public cloud service provider platform. The expression build can have multiple tag types and key-value pairs connected using AND or OR operations.
You can use a maximum of 8 key-value pairs to build the expression for a workload group.
A workload group can be used as a criterion in Internet & SaaS policies such as SSL Inspection, Firewall Filtering, URL Filtering, and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to apply security policies to the workload traffic.
For example, consider workload group A with the following expression:
`VM[(Environment = Prod) OR (SecurityGroup = Load Balancer)]
AND
VPC[(Region = Europe)]`
The workloads with user-defined tags and attributes that match the expression are considered a part of workload group A. Therefore, when workload group A is added as a criterion in the Internet & SaaS policies, the traffic from the workloads under workload group A is forwarded by Cloud Connectors to the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE), and the selected security policies are applied.
Ensure that your organization has a subscription to one of the Workloads SKUs and an account in Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector. When subscribed, contact Zscaler Support to enable the Workload Discovery Service Endpoint to access the Workload Groups feature.
Workload Resources
Workload groups are created using hierarchical scopes, meaning each workload inherits the tags (key-value pair) from the VPC, subnet, VM, and Network Interface resources. When creating [workload groups](/unified/about-workload-groups), if you select the tag type **Any**, you can add tags from any of the resources. However, if there is a conflict with the tags such as duplication of tag keys, you need to choose the appropriate resource to specify that tag.
For example, let us consider a Bastion host having different tags (key-value pair) than the other workloads you have configured. The VPC resource tag type has a tag APP=ACME (key-value pair). However, for the same tag type, the Bastion host has the tag APP=Bastion. In this case, the workload inherits both the tags, and the tag key is duplicated. To resolve this conflict, you can provide alternate permissions by selecting the tag on the VM resource tag type. Then, specify the VM as the tag type for the workload. The tag APP=Bastion is only considered based on the hierarchical scopes.
Zscaler supports the following tag types or resources:
- Network Interface
- Subnet
- VM
- VPC
Zscaler also provides an **Attribute** as a tag type. The user does not define an attribute through tags. However, it is defined by the cloud service provider such as AWS. Zscaler supports the following attributes:
- **GroupId**: The ID of the security group assigned to the attached Elastic Network Interface (ENI). This can identify the AWS Lambda function workload.
- **GroupName**: The name of the security group assigned to the attached ENI.
- **ImageId**: The ID of the image used to launch the instance.
- **PlatformDetails**: The platform. Zscaler also supports AWS Lambda and other services when not used in the context of EC2.
-
**Vpc-id**: The ID of the virtual private cloud (VPC) that ENI runs in.
The Vpc-id attribute as a tag type is different from the VPC resource tag type. When configuring a workload expression, if you select the **Attribute** tag type, and then select Vpc-id as the tag key, then you must add the VPC ID given by AWS as the tag value. However, if you select the **VPC** resource tag type instead of Attribute, and then select Vpc-id as the tag key, you can add any user-defined tag value for the Vpc-id key.
- **IamInstanceProfile-Arn**: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM instance profile.
Every IP address discovered on an ENI contains all the user-defined tags from the tag types that Zscaler supports: `Network Interface`, `Subnet`, `VM`. and `VPC`. Additionally, the attributes derived from the workload are added to the Attributes list.
The final expression of the workload group built using different tag types and key-value pairs displays a 2-dimensional table with a single operator in each row and column.
