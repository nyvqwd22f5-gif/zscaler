A custom view is a saved search criterion that you often reuse and require for your daily operations. You can use it as a rule to trigger a policy. To learn more, see [3rd-Party App Governance Policies](/unified/3rd-party-app-governance-policies). On the Inventory page, you can easily create, access, and edit a custom view.

To create a new custom view:
-
Click** Inventory** in the left-side navigation.

The **Save View** window appears.
-
In the **Save View** window, enter the custom view name. You can also mark the view as a favorite for easier access (this creates a shortcut to the view under **Reports **> **Predefined Reports **in the left-side navigation).

Editing an Existing Custom View
To edit an existing custom view:
- Access an existing custom view.
- Change filters by adding, removing, or adjusting existing ones.
-
Click the **Save** icon.
A confirmation window appears stating that the view already exists.
- Click **Save & Replace** if you want to edit and overwrite it.
If this view is already used as a trigger (rule) for a policy, the confirmation window highlights that, so you may take it under advisement before editing such a view.
