You can create templates to save frequently used alert rule criteria. After saving a template, you can then use it to prefill an alert rule when you configure a Zscaler Hosted probe. To learn more, see [Configuring Zscaler Hosted Probes](/unified/configuring-zscaler-hosted-probes).
Templates provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Create prefilled criteria and fields when configuring an alert rule for Zscaler Hosted probes.
- Save time and maintain consistency when configuring alert rules.
- Flexibility to configure an alert rule.
