By default, configuration warnings appear for application segments, notifying you of an error or existing issue. If you do not want to receive configuration warnings for application segments, you can disable them. You can always enable this option again.
If you disable the configuration warnings, you will not receive messaging about an error or issue for application segments.
Here is an example of a configuration warning for an application segment: If you have an existing wildcard application segment ".example.com" and you add an application segment that is more specified "www.example.com" then you would receive the following warning if the Set Application Configuration Warning is enabled.

To change your configuration warning settings:
- Go to the **Defined Application Segments **page (Policies > Access Control > Private Applications > App Segments)
- (Optional) If your window is compact and resized, click the **Menu **icon (![Menu icon in the Application Segments page](/downloads/zpa/documentation-knowledgebase/applications/application-segments/setting-application-segment-configuration-warnings/menu%20icon.png)
) to view a drop-down menu of the features.
- Click **Set Application Warnings**.

The **Set Application Segment Configuration Warnings** window appears.
- Select **Enabled** to allow configuration warnings to appear. Select **Disabled** to stop receiving configuration warnings. The configuration warning option for application settings is set to **Enabled** by default.
- Click **Save**.
