Locations identify the various networks from which your organization sends its cloud traffic. When you deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector or Zscaler Branch Connector, Zscaler automatically creates a location. The Zscaler service uses a [location template](/unified/about-location-templates) with defined attributes to help create the location.
Locations provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Identify the locations and sublocations from which your organization sends its workload traffic.
- Apply forwarding and security policies to workload traffic.
- Configure various settings such as Firewall Control, Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP), Caution, Authentication, and XFF Forwarding.
- Enforce Bandwidth Control and specify the maximum bandwidth limits for download and upload.
