From the Admin Portal, you can configure notification settings for Zscaler Client Connector.
There are two types of notifications: the default Windows-based notification system and Zscaler’s Notification Framework. While both notification systems provide the same informational messages, users cannot disable notifications from the Zscaler Notification Framework in Windows settings. To learn more, see [Using the Zscaler Notification Framework](/unified/using-zscaler-notification-framework).
Zscaler Client Connector Notification Settings provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Control the notifications that end users receive by default in the system tray and the Zscaler Client Connector Framework.
- Customize the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) users must accept before they can connect to the internet or access your organization's internal resources from devices protected by Zscaler Client Connector.
- Configure a custom banner that displays IT support options for your organization to help users resolve issues.
- Create configuration reminder messages for SecureAgent users and set how often the reminder displays.
- Configure notification templates that you can assign to specific groups of users.
