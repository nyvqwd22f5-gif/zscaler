Through DNS Application Groups, you can create groups based on DNS tunneling traffic as well as other web applications. By allowing or blocking traffic at the DNS level, you gain greater granular control and can create new Firewall policies applied specifically to these groups. To learn more, see [Detecting and Controlling DNS Tunnels](/unified/detecting-and-controlling-dns-tunnels).
DNS application groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Group legitimate DNS tunnels, commonly blocked DNS tunnels, unrecognized DNS tunnels, and DNS network applications (not to be confused with DPI-based network applications) to manage them collectively in the DNS Control policy.
- Enforce condition-based actions on DNS traffic using the DNS Control policy to protect your network traffic against DNS tunneling.
- Investigate and analyze the DNS tunnels detected in your network using Zscaler DNS logs.
