You can download all of your organization's configured policies into a PDF or ZIP file. When you download policies in the ZIP format, a single ZIP file containing JSON representation of the policies is generated. One JSON file is created for each policy type within the ZIP file. In addition to downloading policies, you can print your policies.
Policies that support the **View by** option can be printed either in **Rule Order** or **Rule Label** view.
To download or print all policies, go to **Policies **> **Common Configurations** > **Advanced** > **View All Policies**.
- To download policies, click the **Download** drop-down menu and select **PDF** or **ZIP** per your requirements. Selecting **ZIP** automatically downloads the policy contents into a **ZIP** file. If you select the PDF option, a window appears where you can change your preferred settings and then click **Save**.
-
To print policies, click **Print**. In the window that appears, you can change your preferred settings and then proceed to print the policies.
