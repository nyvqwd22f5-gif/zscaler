You can create user-related [widgets](/unified/about-widgets) in the [dashboard](/unified/about-dashboards) and [reports](/unified/about-interactive-reports) or when [analyzing charts](/unified/analyzing-traffic-using-insights) in Web, Mobile, Firewall, or DNS Insights. For example, you can create a report to view and export a list of users who browse the web the most.
Excluding locations also applies to the [Executive Report](/unified/executive-insights-report) and all standard, user-related reports in [Interactive Reports](/unified/about-interactive-reports).
Excluding Locations in Widgets
By default, user-related widgets include locations and users. You can exclude locations by creating new or editing existing widgets and using the **Exclude Location** filter. This filter applies to all user-related widgets except for widgets in the default Security** **dashboard.
For example, if you edit the user-related widget **Top Users **in the Web Overview dashboard, choose the filter** User** and enable the **Exclude Location** toggle.

- From the **Data Type **drop-down menu, choose **User**.
