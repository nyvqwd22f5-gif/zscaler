The most common way to define a location in the Admin Portal is by specifying a static public IP address. But if your organization does not have a static public IP address, you can still define a location by either subscribing to a [dedicated proxy port](/unified/configuring-dedicated-proxy-ports) or by configuring an [IPSec VPN tunnel](/unified/configuring-ipsec-vpn-tunnel) to forward internet traffic to the Zscaler service and specifying an FQDN for the VPN credentials.
