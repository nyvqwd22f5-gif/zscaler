You can upgrade the ZDX Module for Windows via the CLI if you want to deploy an upgrade separately from a Zscaler Client Connector upgrade. Before you can use a [downloaded package](/unified/viewing-and-configuring-zdx-module-upgrades) to [upgrade via the CLI](/unified/interacting-zscaler-client-connector-remotely), you must enable this feature.
This feature is available only for Zscaler Client Connector version 4.7 and later for Windows.
To enable ZDX Module upgrades via the CLI:
- In the Admin Portal, go to** Infrastructure** > **Connectors** >** Client**.
- Under Platform Settings, select **Windows** and click the **Platform Settings** tab.
-
Enable **Allow ZDX Client Upgrade via CLI**.
