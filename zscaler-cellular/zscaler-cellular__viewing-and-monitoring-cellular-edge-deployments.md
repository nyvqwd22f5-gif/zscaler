Zscaler deploys and maintains Cellular Edges that serve as secure access on-ramps to the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE), ensuring seamless and secure connectivity for your devices. Depending on your usage requirements, you can request additional Cellular Edges in your preferred regions. You can also monitor the deployment and service status of the Cellular Edges directly from the Zscaler Cellular Admin Portal.
To view the Cellular Edge deployments:
-
In the left-side navigation, select **Deployment Regions**.
The **Deployment Regions** page appears.

On the **Deployment Regions **page, you can view regions on the map where Cellular Edges are deployed. The regions are color-coded to indicate the following deployment and service statuses:
- **Online**: Represented by a green color, indicating that the service is fully operational.
- **Disruption**: Represented by a red color, signaling a complete service outage or unavailability.
- **Degradation**: Represented by a gray color, highlighting reduced performance or partial service issues.
- **Pending Deployment**: Represented by a yellow color, indicating that deployment of Cellular Edges is currently underway for the region but not yet active.
