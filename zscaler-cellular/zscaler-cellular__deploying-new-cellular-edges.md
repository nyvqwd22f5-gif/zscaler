Deploying additional Cellular Edges ensures that your devices have seamless and secure connectivity to the Zscaler cloud in the designated regions where you need additional coverage or capacity. Zscaler Cellular offers coverage expansion in three regions: AMER (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APAC (Asia-Pacific). Deploying more Cellular Edges allows you to expand the reach of your Zscaler Cellular services, improve performance by reducing latency, and ensure reliable network access for IoT devices and other connected systems. On the Deployment Regions Page, you can identify regions requiring deployment and submit requests for provisioning new Cellular Edges.
Before requesting new Cellular Edges, ensure that you have a subscription for the region where you want to deploy them.
