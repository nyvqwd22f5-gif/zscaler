You can manage eSIMs provisioned for your organization from the Zscaler Cellular Admin Portal. After provisioning, the eSIMs are listed on the SIMs page. From that page, you can access the SIM details page for each SIM to view its details and assign or activate it.
This feature is in limited availability. To access this feature, contact your Zscaler Account team.
