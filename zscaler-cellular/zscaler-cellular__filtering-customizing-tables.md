In the Zscaler Cellular Admin Portal, the data is organized and displayed in tables. You can customize the table to show specific columns, filter the data to refine your view, or sort the columns to adjust the order of entries.
You can do the following:
For pages that include a date range selector, before applying any customization, ensure that you have selected the required date range using the time range drop-down menu.

- [Show or Hide Columns](#show-hide-columns)
- [Sort Table Data](#sort-table-data)
- [Apply Filters](#apply-filters)
- [Customize Page Size](#customize-page-size)
- [Pagination Control](#pagination-control)
[]You can adjust the table's layout by selecting which columns to display or hide for a more focused view of the data. To show or hide a column, click the **Column Chooser** icon in the top-right corner of the table and click the column names to show or hide the respective columns from the table. Selected columns are displayed in the table and unchecked columns are hidden from the table.

[]You can sort your table data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns (indicated by two arrows on the column header). To sort table data by a specific column, click the column header.

[]You can refine the data that the table displays by applying filters to focus on specific criteria.
To apply filters:
- Click the name of the filter parameter in the top-left corner of the page.
-
Enter the value for the parameter.
[See image.](#apply-single-filter)
- Click **Add**.
If the page has multiple filters, you can combine them by repeating the above steps for each filter.

When a page has more than two filters, some of the filter parameters are hidden. To choose the specific filter parameter, click the **Add **icon next to the filter options and select the preferred parameter.
[]You can set the number of rows displayed per page to suit your preference or screen size. To do this, select the number of rows per page from the page size drop-down menu in the bottom-left corner of the page.

[]You can navigate through the table by moving between pages using the arrows or jumping directly to a specific page using the pagination control at the bottom of the page.
