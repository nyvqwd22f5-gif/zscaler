#### Support for eSIMs
Zscaler Cellular supports eSIMs (embedded SIMs) in addition to traditional physical SIM cards, providing flexibility for organizations adopting eSIM technology. This enhancement allows administrators to view, manage, and activate both physical SIMs and eSIMs directly from the Zscaler Cellular Admin Portal.
With this update:
-
eSIMs provisioned to your organization automatically display on the SIMs page. The Form Factor column identifies whether a SIM is an eSIM.

-
Administrators can assign, activate, or deactivate eSIMs directly from the Zscaler Cellular Admin Portal.
