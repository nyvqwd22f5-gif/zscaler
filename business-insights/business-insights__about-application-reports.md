You can schedule an application's activity or inactivity reports for regular distribution to specified recipients. For example, you can schedule the Slack activity report for weekly distribution to your IT department and CIO.
Application reports are emailed as links to recipients. You can also integrate the reports with [Workflow Automation](/workflow-automation/what-workflow-automation) to create a workflow to take action on inactive users, etc.
Application reports provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Schedule reports for various criteria and distribute them to your choice of email recipients, integrate with Workflow Automation, or both.
- Frequently track application usage and take action for unused user licenses.
- Integrate with Workflow Automation with a defined workflow to manage and automate actions required from various teams or departments involved in acting on the report's outcome, including the users.
