At times, Zscaler Support might need access to your Business Insights Admin Portal for a limited period to troubleshoot issues. With Remote Assistance, you can allow Zscaler Support to securely and remotely log in to the portal. This can be done with either view-only or full admin privileges. You do not need to create new admin accounts or share passwords to enable access for either option.
This procedure allows Zscaler Support to access the portal until the specified date.
To enable remote assistance:
- Log in to the Business Insights Admin Portal.
- Go to **Help **>** Remote Assistance**.

- In the **Remote Assistance** window, select your access preferences and user name visibility.
- Select **Enable View Only Access**, **Enable Full Access**, or both.
After enabling your access preferences, select the amount of time you want the access enabled. Zscaler recommends that you select a length of at least one year when choosing view-only access and at least two days when choosing full access.
- Select either **Obfuscated** or **Visible **for the **User Names** option. By default, this is set to **Visible**.
The user names are obfuscated automatically for all the SSO users if the **User Names** is set to **Obfuscated**.
The SSO users cannot change this setting. Only admin users with Remote Assistance Management enabled for their role can make changes in the **Remote Assistance** window.
