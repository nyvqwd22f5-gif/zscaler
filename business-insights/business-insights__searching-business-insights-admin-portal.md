- Toggle names
- Tooltips or other text
To search the portal:
- Hover over the **Search **icon in the navigation menu. The search field appears.

- Enter your search text. The portal automatically activates the cursor in the search bar, so you don't need to click before typing.
The search provides auto-complete suggestions as you enter text.
