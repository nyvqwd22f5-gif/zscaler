The Workplace Tags feature can be used for linking workplaces to user-defined tags. These tags are then leveraged as a filtering option in viewing workplace insights. Admins can create tag categories as necessary and add multiple tags to them. You can add a maximum of 8 tag categories, and each category can consist of 8 tags. For example, you can create a tag category called Region and add tags that indicate the region of the workplace, like Europe, America, Asia, etc. This helps to filter workplace insights for specific regions when required in the Business Insights Admin Portal.
You can choose to tag workplaces using dynamic or manual tagging. With dynamic tagging, you can configure criteria based on which workplaces are automatically linked to a tag, or use manual tagging to individually select the workplaces that you want to link to a tag.
Tags provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Link various tags to workplaces as per your organization's requirements.
- Filter and view workplace insights based on user-defined tags.
- Provide the flexibility to tag multiple workplaces based on the configured criteria with dynamic tagging.
