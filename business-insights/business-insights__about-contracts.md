When an organization establishes a contract with vendors to subscribe to SaaS applications, you can upload that contract to the Business Insights Admin Portal. This assists in analyzing the contract for metadata such as the licensing models (i.e., per user, per GB of data, feature based, or an amalgamation of the preceding models), contract end, renewal date, etc. You can visualize each application's annual contract value (ACV) and total contract value (TCV) along with the overall ACV and TCV values from your entire SaaS application subscriptions. The All Contracts page gathers the contract insights in graphs and tables to provide a better SaaS spending overview. This equips you with the necessary insights to take informed actions for maintaining efficient SaaS spending.
To facilitate accurate contract insights, the Business Insights service recommends uploading all your SaaS application contracts. To learn more, see [Uploading Application Contracts](/business-insights/uploading-application-contracts). You can upload the latest contracts when they are renewed or modified.
Contracts provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Search and view a list of application contracts set up by application vendors.
- Track various upcoming deadlines for the contracts.
- View different licensing models for contracts in one table.
- View the ACV and TCV graph trends accumulated for the application contracts.
