You can configure occupancy and attendance goals for an office to track metrics against the configured goals and take necessary actions to achieve them.
To configure occupancy and attendance goals for an office:
- Go to **Workplace** > **Workplace Settings**.
-
Locate the office for which you want to configure goals, and click the **Edit** icon.
The **Edit Office** drawer appears.
-
In the **Edit** **Office** drawer:
- **Occupancy Goal Percentage**: Enter the occupancy goal between 1 and 100. For example, if you set the occupancy to 30, the office is expected to be occupied by at least 30% of its assigned users.
- **Attendance Goal Percentage**: Enter the attendance goal (i.e., 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days per week, respectively). For example, if the attendance goal is set to 40, the users assigned to the office are expected to come into the office at least 2 days per week.
