The** My Profile** page appears:
- On the **My Profile** page:
- **User Name**: Your login ID assigned when your admin account was created.
- **Password**: Click **Change Password** to change the password to the Business Insights Admin Portal. The Zscaler service applies the strongest restrictions and complexity. The password must contain at least 8 characters and include one number, one uppercase character, and one special character. Only ASCII characters are allowed.
- **Language**: By default, the Business Insights Admin Portal is displayed in English. You can change the language to French, German, Japanese, Spanish, or Simplified Chinese.
- **Auto Refresh Dashboard?**: Enable to automatically refresh the dashboards every 15 minutes.
- **Policy Information**: Enable to display policy descriptions at the top of each policy window in the Business Insights Admin Portal.
- **Timezone**: When the Zscaler service saves transactions, it uses UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The time zone is used only for exporting logs to CSV files. It does not affect the generated logs in the Business Insights Admin Portal because the system time zone determines the time stamp of the generated logs.
