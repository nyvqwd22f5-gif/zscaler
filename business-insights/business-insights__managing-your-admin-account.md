The My Profile page displays your basic account information (i.e., username, organization ID, and cloud name) for your Business Insights Admin Portal account. Additionally, you can change your account password on this page.
Changing Your Password
To change your password:
- Go to **My Profile**.
- Click **Change Password**.
The **Change Password** window appears.
- In the **Change Password** window:
- **Old Password**: Enter your current password used for logging in to the Business Insights Admin Portal.
- **New Password**: Enter a new password.
- **Confirm New Password**: Re-type the new password.
- Click **Save**.
After you change your password, the current Business Insights Admin Portal session expires, and the service prompts you to log in using the new password.
