The Contract Settings page helps you manage contract-related settings.
To manage contract settings:
- Go to **Applications** > **Application Settings** > **Contract Settings**.
- On the **Contract Settings** page:
- **Default Currency**: Use the **Currency** drop-down to select the default currency for calculating and displaying various contract-related prices, such as annual contract value (ACV), total contract value (TCV), etc.
-
**Contract File Deletion**: Select the time frame after which the uploaded contracts must be deleted by the Business Insights service.
- **Date**: Select **Upload Date** (the date when the contract is uploaded) or **Expiration Date **(the date when the contract expires). The selection is considered as a reference date from which the contract retention time is calculated.
- **Contract Retention**: Select the number of days from the upload or expiration date of contracts after which the Business Insights service permanently deletes the contract files (e.g., 7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 days).
