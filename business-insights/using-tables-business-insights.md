Data in the Business Insights Admin Portal is organized and displayed in tables. You can modify the default settings for each table. Every time you make a change, the settings are stored in your browser's local storage so that your changes are preserved the next time you log in.
If you clear your cache or use a different browser, your settings are lost.
You can do the following:
- [Reorder columns](#reorder)
- [Resize columns](#resize)
- [Hide columns](#hide)
- [Sort the column data](#sort)
- [Reset table to default settings](#reset)
[]You can reorder columns in one of two ways:
- [From the Table](#from-table)
- [From the Column Menu settings](#from-column-menu-settings)
[]When you hover over a column header in the table, a **Move** cursor appears. To reorder the column, drag and drop it to the desired location. An arrow indicates where the column is placed. The table refreshes and displays data in the new column order.
The column menu settings also change to reflect the new order.

[]When you hover over a listed column name in the settings, a **Move** cursor appears. Drag and drop the column name to the desired position. The table refreshes and displays the data in the new column order.

[]When the data in a column takes up more space than the viewing area allows, it is truncated. You can view the truncated data in the tooltip. You can also increase the column width.
To increase the column width, hover over the right border of the column. A **Resize** icon appears. Adjust the column to the desired width.

[]When you do not need to view all the columns at the same time, you can hide them so only the columns you want to view are visible.
To hide a column, hover over the **Column Menu** or **Gear** icon on the top right of the table, and uncheck the column names you want to hide. The table refreshes and displays only the checked columns.
For tables under **Administration **pages, you must have at least one column visible at all times.

[]Some columns have a sort icon indicating that you can sort the data in those columns. You can sort data in ascending or descending order.
To sort a column, click on the sort icon in the table column header.

[]When you make changes to the columns, you can go back to the default settings by hovering over the **Column Menu** and clicking the **Reset** icon.
This doesn't reset your sort order.
