This article explains how to leverage various features available in the Business Insights Admin Portal to view accurate and rich applications and workplace insights. Business Insights is divided into two categories—applications and workplace—and also includes reports and administration management to manage your admins. To learn more, see [What Is Zscaler Business Insights?](/business-insights/what-zscaler-business-insights) and [Understanding Business Insights Architecture.](/business-insights/understanding-business-insights-architecture)
Applications
To view your organization's SaaS application and its contract insights to make business-critical decisions like offloading applications, reducing licenses, and switching to more cost-effective alternatives, consider configuring the following features:
- To view accurate application insights about their usage, active and inactive users, and costs—among many other vital metrics—consider configuring sanctioned applications to pull usage information and view insights. Zscaler recommends configuring a SaaS application connector (requires admin access to the app) for the supported apps, or creating custom application signatures to pull metrics from a specific URL of the application per your requirements. To learn more, see [About Application Configuration](/business-insights/about-application-configuration).
- While configuring applications helps in viewing accurate insights, uploading application contracts with all your vendors helps in managing and viewing annual contract value (ACV), total contract value (TCV), SaaS spending, deadlines, and licensing models. To learn more, see [About Contracts](/business-insights/about-contracts).
- Tags for linking applications and contracts to user-defined tags. Tagging is leveraged as a filtering option for viewing insights. To learn more, see [About Application Tags](/business-insights/about-application-tags) and [About Contract Tags](/business-insights/about-contract-tags).
After configuring the preceding features, refer to the following articles to view and analyze application insights in the Business Insights Admin Portal:

Workplace
To view your organization's workplace insights to manage your workforce and workplace more effectively, and also make business-critical decisions like opening, shutting down, and optimizing offices, consider configuring the following features:
- Offices for all your workplaces that are being used by your organization to efficiently track and manage the workforce and workplaces. To learn more, see [About Configured Offices](/business-insights/about-configured-offices).
- Organization and office-level attendance goals to gauge workplace attendance against the defined goals. To learn more, see [Configuring Organization-Level Occupancy & Attendance Goals](/business-insights/configuring-organization-level-occupancy-attendance-goals) and [Configuring Occupancy & Attendance Goals for an Office](/business-insights/configuring-occupancy-attendance-goals-office).
- Department Mapping to categorize multiple departments into a division to filter and view workplace insights for specific divisions. To learn more, see [About Department Mapping](/business-insights/about-department-mapping).
- Tags for linking offices to user-defined tags. Tagging is leveraged as a filtering option for viewing insights for workplaces. To learn more, see [About Workplace Tags](/business-insights/about-tag-management).
