Application configuration is a significant action that a Business Insights admin must perform to pull usage information for applications and view their insights. Zscaler recommends configuring a SaaS application connector (requires admin access to the app) for the supported apps, or creating custom application signatures to pull metrics from a specific URL of the application per your requirements.
Application configuration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Configure an application connector or customer application signature for which you want to view the insights.
- View a list of custom application signatures configured to view application insights.
About the Configuration Page
On the Configuration page (Application > Application Settings), you can do the following:
- [Configure a connector from the supported SaaS applications](/business-insights/onboarding-saas-apps-business-insights).
- [Create a custom application signature](business-insights/creating-custom-application-signatures).
- View a list of custom application signatures. For each signature, you can view:
- **Application**: The name of the custom application signature.
- **Associated SaaS Application**: The name of the application for which the signature is created. This helps to display metadata if the application is known to the Business Insights service and impacts the experience in the [Discovered Apps](/business-insights/about-application-inventory#discovered-apps), [Overlapping Apps](/business-insights/about-application-inventory#overlapping-apps), and [Cost Savings](/business-insights/about-application-inventory#cost-savings) metrics.
- **Signature**: The signature details.
- **Description**: Shows any description added to the signature. For example, login events for Salesforce, creating a board in Miro, etc.
- [Modify the table columns](/business-insights/using-tables-business-insights).
- [Edit a custom application signature](/business-insights/editing-or-deleting-items-business-insights).
- [Delete a custom application signature](/business-insights/editing-or-deleting-items-business-insights).
