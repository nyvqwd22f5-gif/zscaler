Application Comparison
This table compares the apps in terms of engagement index, growth trend, etc. For each app, you can view:
- **Application**: The name of the application along with its logo.
- **Website**: The application's website.
- **Description**: The description of the application.
- **Data Source**: The source from where the application usage is discovered (i.e., identity provider (IdP), Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), by connector integration, or custom application signature such as **IDP**, **ZIA**, **CONNECTOR**,** **or** CUSTOM ZIA**).
- **Active Users**: The number of active users for the app.
- **Growth Trend**: The percentage increase or decrease in user activity for every 30 days. For example, if you have 50 active users in the last 30 days but 100 active users before the last 30 days, the growth trend is calculated by dividing the increase or decrease in the number of active users by the number of active users before the last 30 days, and multiplying it by 100 ([100−50]÷100×100 = decrease of 50%).
- **Engagement Index**: The percentage of active users in the last 30 days over the last 90 days for an app. For example, if you have 50 active users in the last 30 days and 100 in the last 90 days for Box, the engagement index is calculated by dividing the number of active users in the last 30 days by the number of active users in the last 90 days, and multiplying it by 100 (i.e., [50÷100]×100 = 50%).
- **Top 5 Departments**: The top 5 departments by app usage.
- **Spend**: The amount spent (in US Dollars) by the organization on the app subscription.
- **Contract Date**: The date when the app subscription ends.
