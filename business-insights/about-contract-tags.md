The Contract Tags feature can be used for linking contracts to user-defined tags. These tags are then leveraged as a filtering option when viewing contracts. Admins can create tag categories as necessary and add multiple tags to them. You can add a maximum of 8 tag categories, and each category can consist of 8 tags. For example, you can create a tag category called Yearly Spend and add tags that indicate the money spent on application contracts, like Less than 1 Million, More than 1 Million, etc. This helps to filter contracts with specific yearly spend in the Business Insights Admin Portal.
You can tag contracts using dynamic or manual tagging. With dynamic tagging, you can configure criteria based on which contracts are automatically linked to a tag, or use manual tagging to individually select contracts that you want to link to a tag.
Contracts Tags provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Link various tags to contracts as per your organization's requirements.
- Filter and view contract insights based on user-defined tags.
- Provide the flexibility to tag multiple contracts based on the configured criteria with dynamic tagging.
