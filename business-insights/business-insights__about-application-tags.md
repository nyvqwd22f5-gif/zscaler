The Application Tags feature can be used for linking applications to user-defined tags. These tags can be leveraged in filtering application insights. Admins can create tag categories as necessary and add multiple tags to them. You can add a maximum of 8 tag categories, and each category can consist of 8 tags. For example, you can create a tag category called Significant Apps and add tags that indicate the levels of significance for the applications, like High, Low, Medium, etc. This helps to filter applications with specific significance in the Business Insights Admin Portal.
You can tag applications using dynamic or manual tagging. With dynamic tagging, you can configure criteria based on which applications are automatically linked to a tag, or use manual tagging to individually select applications that you want to link to a tag.
Application Tags provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Link various tags to applications as per your organization's requirements.
- Filter and view application insights based on user-defined tags.
- Provide the flexibility to tag multiple applications based on the configured criteria with dynamic tagging.
