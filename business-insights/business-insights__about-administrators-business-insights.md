The Administration page helps you add and manage admins for the Business Insights Admin Portal. Admins can view the business insights for apps and workplaces, among other privileges.
Administration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Add admins for the Business Insights Admin Portal.
- Provide access to the features specific to an admin's role and scope.
Zscaler provides a default admin account, full access to the Business Insights Admin Portal, and scope. As a default admin, you can:
- Enable or disable the default admin account status, but you cannot delete the account.
- Add as many additional admins as necessary to meet the specific needs of your organization.
- Edit and delete admins as necessary at any time.
On the Administrators page, you can only edit an existing admin's scope if you are subscribed to the ZIdentity service. These admins are configured in the [ZIdentity Admin Portal](/zidentity/accessing-and-navigating-zidentity-admin-portal). To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
