Role-based administration helps you delegate different types of admins to the Business Insights Admin Portal. You can set the scope and permission level for an admin to ensure that admins can only access their designated areas in the Business Insights Admin Portal with the appropriate permissions.
To configure role-based administration:
- [Add admin roles](/business-insights/adding-admin-roles-business-insights).
