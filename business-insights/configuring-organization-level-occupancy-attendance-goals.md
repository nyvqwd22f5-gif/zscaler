You can set organization-level occupancy and attendance goals to track metrics against the configured goals and take necessary actions to achieve them. Individual office goals can be configured in the respective office's Edit Office drawers. To learn more, see [Configuring Occupancy & Attendance Goals for an Office](/business-insights/configuring-occupancy-attendance-goals-office).
To configure organization-level goals:
- Go to **Workplace** > **Workplace Settings**.
- Click the **Occupancy and Attendance Goals **tab.
- In the **Occupancy Goal Percentage **field, enter the occupancy goal between 1 and 100 (e.g., if the occupancy goal is set to 60, the offices are expected to be occupied by at least 60% of their assigned users).
-
In the **Attendance** **Goal** **Percentage** field, enter the attendance goal (i.e., 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days per week, respectively). For example, if the attendance goal is set to 40, the users are expected to come into the office at least 2 days per week.
