Department Mapping is used to categorize multiple organizational departments under a division to view metrics for the division. For example, if you have three departments in your organization that belong or relate to a division called Marketing, you can map these departments and view metrics specifically for the Marketing division in Workplace Insights.
Department Mapping provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Map departments to a division based on your requirements.
- View workplace metrics based on divisions.
About Department Mapping
On the Department Mapping page (Workplace > Workplace Settings > Department Mapping), you can do the following:
- [Map a department](/business-insights/mapping-departments). If you've added at least one mapping, the **Add Departments** option changes to **Edit Mapping**. Click **Edit Mapping** to map more departments.
- View a list of mapped departments. For each mapping, you can view:
- **Division**: The name of the division.
- **Departments**: The departments that are mapped to the division.
- **Number of Departments**: The number of departments mapped to the division.
- **Employees**: The number of employees mapped to the division.
