Business Insights provides intuitive visualization and reporting metrics for your SaaS app usage and workplace-related data in a centralized [Business Insights Admin Portal](https://admin.zscaleranalytics.net/) that helps with:
- Cost reduction and savings across SaaS apps by downsizing underutilized licenses and overlapping apps.
- Driving return to office strategy and analyzing office utilization metrics and their pattern of usage, whether hybrid or remote, for efficient workplace management.
To set up and view Business Insights for your organization, you must consider the following prerequisites:
- To gain SaaS app insights, you must be subscribed to the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) service.
- To gain workplace insights, in addition to the ZIA service, you must have Zscaler Client Connector deployed on all relevant endpoints you want to track for office utilization.
Business Insights Architecture
Business Insights receives signals and data from 4 data sources: the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) service that acts as one of the input feeders, identity providers (IdPs) like Okta and Entra ID, SaaS application connector integrations (supported for apps such as Okta, M365, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Box, Google, and GitHub), and [custom application signatures](/business-insights/about-application-configuration). Zscaler's direct connector integration to view business insights overextends other data source functionalities. However, Business Insights provides metrics even when integration into a specific app is not available with the help of other data sources.
Business Insights can differentiate between your subscribed apps vs. used apps by populating metadata fields that show subscription details, such as cost, license plans, contract start dates, end dates, etc. All of these fields can be filtered to present a report of representative apps. At the same time, Business Insights also presents the app usage and workplace data by analyzing your ZIA traffic, identity provider (login data), or API integrations (direct app connectors) to help you save business costs.
Zscaler can discover the usage of over 30K apps. By default, only a subset of these apps are shown in the portal, depending on your business relevance, to help streamline your experience and avoid unnecessary information.
