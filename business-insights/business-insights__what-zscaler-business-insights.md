Zscaler Business Insights provides 360-degree visibility into your organization's SaaS application usage and spending insights, along with workplace metrics to help you save money and manage your workplace efficiently.
SaaS Application Management
Nowadays, organizations depend on multiple applications to complete their day-to-day operations. This results in an unconstrained number of applications being consumed, which makes the application landscape management difficult within an organization. The challenges include:
- The process of gathering metrics and reports from various cross-functional teams, such as Accounting, IT, and Vendor Management to build an understanding of your application usage can be time-consuming.
- The majority of the application metrics are manually entered into a spreadsheet and must be updated frequently.
- The users' application engagement metrics for an application must be gathered manually from the application, if available.
Business Insights serves as a centralized engagement interface for all your licensed applications, and eliminates all the preceding challenges by providing the necessary information to effectively manage and optimize your application landscape.
By analyzing your application usage trends with Business Insights, you're equipped with accurate data to renew the correct number of licenses required by your organization. For example, if an organization purchases more than the required number of Microsoft 365 licenses, the data for how many of the purchased licenses are actually being used can be analyzed with the help of Business Insights and, subsequently, reduce the number of licenses during the renewal process.
