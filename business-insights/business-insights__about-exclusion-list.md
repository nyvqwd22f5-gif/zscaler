An exclusion is a set of criteria that can be used to exclude users and departments for applications' activity or inactivity data from a scheduled report. You can add multiple exclusions, however you can only enable up to 8 exclusions at any time. If you choose to apply the exclusion list when scheduling a report, the report excludes the users and departments using all the enabled exclusions. The enabled exclusions must also match the applications configured in the scheduled reports for the exclusion to be associated with the reports.
Whenever you disable, modify, or enable an exclusion, the existing scheduled reports that use the exclusion list are generated considering the latest exclusion list.
The Exclusion List provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Exclude users and departments from a scheduled report.
- Update exclusions to modify multiple reports' criteria in one attempt.
About the Exclusion List

- **Users**: The users selected for exclusion from reports.
