The roles that are assigned to admins dictate the level of access they have to the Business Insights Admin Portal. Zscaler provides a default super admin role that has full access to the Business Insights Admin Portal. This role is assigned to the default admin, but you can assign this role to other admins as necessary.
Configuring an admin is one of the tasks you must complete while configuring role-based administration. To learn more, see [Configuring Role-Based Administration](/business-insights/configuring-role-based-administration-business-insights).
Roles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure admins for the Business Insights Admin Portal based on their role.
- Assign roles to admins to maintain hierarchy among the admins so that the admin can't modify the settings of an admin with a broader scope.
- View all the configured admins, their access levels, and other information.
