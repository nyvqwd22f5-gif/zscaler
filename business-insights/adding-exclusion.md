Add exclusions to set criteria for excluding users and departments from a scheduled report. You can add multiple exclusions, however you can only enable up to 8 exclusions at any time. If you choose to apply the exclusion list when scheduling a report, the report excludes the users and departments using only the enabled exclusions.
To add an exclusion:
- Go to **Analytics** > **Reports** > **Application Reports** > **Exclusion List**.
-
Click **Add Exclusion**.
A new row is added at the bottom of the exclusion list.
-
In the new columns:
- **Users**: Select the users that you want to add to the exclusion.
- **Departments**: Select the departments that you want to add to the exclusion.
- **Applications**: Select the applications that you want to add to the exclusion. Enabled exclusions are associated with only those scheduled reports where the applications configured in both the scheduled report and the exclusion match.
- **Enabled**: Select this option to enable the exclusion. You can disable this option at any time.
-
**Action**: Click the checkmark** **icon (![Business-Insights-check.png](/downloads/business-insights/reports/adding-exclusion/Business-Insights-check.png)
