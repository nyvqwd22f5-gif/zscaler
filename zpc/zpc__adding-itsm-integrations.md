IT Service Management (ITSM) tools are used to collect data such as alerts or audit logs from your cloud assets for further data analysis. This analysis helps identify potential risks, so you can take the necessary remediation steps and maintain the security posture of your cloud assets.
Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) leverages ServiceNow APIs to automatically create tickets when a misconfiguration is detected. You can integrate ZPC with [ServiceNow](/zpc/integrating-servicenow) or [Jira](/zpc/integrating-jira) and transfer the audit logs for further analysis and remediation.
