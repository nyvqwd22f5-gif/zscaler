Cloud Storage is a service that allows you to store and organize data. You can granularly control access to this data and use it for data analysis, auditing, threat detection, etc., based on your organization's security and compliance requirements.
Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) can be integrated with cloud storage solutions, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Security Lake, and Azure Blob Storage services to store and manage your data logs. The integration enables ZPC to send the alert data logs to these cloud storage services.
You can integrate ZPC with the following cloud storage services:
- [Amazon S3](/zpc/integrating-amazon-s3)
- [Azure Blob Storage](/zpc/integrating-azure-blob-storage)
- [Amazon Security Lake](/zpc/integrating-amazon-security-lake)
Only ZPC administrators can configure cloud storage integrations.
