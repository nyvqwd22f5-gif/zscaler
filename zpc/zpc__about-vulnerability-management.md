Vulnerability Management is a process to continuously monitor, identify, investigate, and remediate security vulnerabilities in your cloud workloads in order to maintain the security posture of your cloud environment. Vulnerability management enables you to proactively identify and fix potential security issues and prevent any cybersecurity threat, data breaches, or other security incidents.
The Vulnerability Management feature in Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) proactively scans your cloud workloads for vulnerability and provides detailed reports of the vulnerabilities detected in your container registry images and cloud instances. You can analyze the scan results, identify the most vulnerable resources, investigate and prioritize the risk, and take the necessary remediation steps. You can also create custom vulnerability scanning rules for specific resources. For more information, see [About Vulnerability Scanning](/zpc/about-vulnerability-scanning).
Vulnerability management includes the following benefits and enables you to:
- Discover and monitor all active cloud workloads (container registries, repositories, instances, etc.).
- Recognize key assets and prioritize efforts to strengthen the security posture of the assets to reduce security risk.
- Identify, prioritize, and remediate critical vulnerabilities and potential threats.
- Mitigate security risks, minimize system downtime, and protect data.
- Prevent access and data exploitation by threat actors.
- Replace manual workflows with automated scanning, alerting, and remediation processes.
- Obtain real-time visibility of potential threats and vulnerabilities through interactive dashboards and reports.
- Integrate with SIEM or ITSM tools for event management and investigation.
- Maintain compliance with various security standards and regulations.
