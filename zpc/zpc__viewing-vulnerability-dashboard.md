A vulnerability is a misconfiguration or security flaw in the cloud infrastructure that is a potential risk for cyber threats. It is crucial for organizations to implement a standard process for monitoring and identifying such vulnerabilities and taking the necessary remediation steps to maintain the security posture of their cloud infrastructure.
The Vulnerability Dashboard offers insight into your container registry and cloud workload vulnerability across Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This dashboard displays the detected vulnerabilities correlated with the common vulnerabilities and exposure (CVE) defined in the [national vulnerability database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD) database and prioritizes the vulnerabilities and the associated risk based on the [common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) score](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss). To learn more about vulnerabilities, see [About Vulnerability Integrations](/zpc/about-vulnerability-integrations).
Most dashboard widgets and icons are interactive. You can drill down to view the Vulnerability Dashboard in more detail.
On the Vulnerability Dashboard page (Dashboard > Vulnerability), you can view the following vulnerabilities:
- [Cloud Workloads](#cloudworkloads)
- [Containers](#containertab)
- [Container Registry Images](#containerregistryimages)
[]On the **Container Registry Images** tab, you can:
- Filter identities by the following parameters. To learn more about filters, see [Using Filters](/zpc/using-filters).
- **Cloud Type**: Select one or multiple cloud service providers.
- **Time Range**: Select 1 day, 7 days, 15 days, or 30 days.
- **Business Units**: Select one or multiple Business Units.
- View the **Vulnerability By Severity** donut chart. View the vulnerability count categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unknown). The severity is determined based on the CVSS score.
- View **Vulnerability By Fix**. View the fixable and non-fixable vulnerability count categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unknown).
- View **Top 10 Critical CVE**. View the top ten critical CVEs by image count.
- View **Top 10 Repositories By Vulnerability**. View the top 10 container repositories by vulnerability count.
- View **Top 10 Images by Vulnerabilities**. View the top 10 images by vulnerability count.
- View **Top 10 Vulnerable Packages**. View the top ten vulnerable packages.
- Apply the saved filters.
- Hide the filters.
- Customize the dashboard by selecting the required registry image data you want to see.
