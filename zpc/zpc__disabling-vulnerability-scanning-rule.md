When you add a vulnerability scanning rule, by default, the scanning rule is enabled. However, you can choose to disable the vulnerability scanning when required.
To disable a vulnerability scanning rule:
- Go to **Cloud Posture** > **Vulnerability Management**.
- On the **Vulnerability Management** page, click the **Scanning Rules** tab.
The list of scanning rules is displayed.
- Click the toggle under the **Rule Status** column for the selected scanning rule.
