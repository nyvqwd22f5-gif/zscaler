A role determines the set of tasks that users can perform in the ZPC Admin Portal based on the permissions. In ZPC, roles are always assigned to groups and all users belonging to that group are assigned the same role.
ZPC provides a set of [predefined roles and permissions](/zpc/predefined-roles-and-permissions) that can be assigned to groups. You can also [create and assign custom roles](/zpc/adding-custom-role) to groups.To learn more, see [About Groups](/zpc/about-groups).
Roles include the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure and manage role-based access control by assigning predefined or custom roles for users within your organization.
- Configure administrators based on their responsibilities in the organization.
- Allow user access to specific modules in ZPC.
- View all the configured administrators, their access levels, functional scope, and other details.
Modules
The ZPC features are classified as:
- **Global Modules**: The ZPC modules where data is not segregated by cloud accounts and [business units](/zpc/about-business-units) are not applicable for these modules.
- **Modules**: The ZPC modules where data can be filtered by cloud accounts that are associated with business units. The business unit filters are applicable for these modules.
