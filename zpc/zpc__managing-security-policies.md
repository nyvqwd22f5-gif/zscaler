You can edit or delete a previously created policy if it's no longer relevant to your organization's security posture needs. If you delete the custom security policy, all alerts generated by the custom policy are closed.

Editing Custom Security Policies
Editing a custom security policy might have impact on the alerts ZPC generates. If you edit the custom policy information, such as policy title or remediation procedure, the new information reflects in the Alerts page and the Cloud Threats dashboard. If you edit the custom policy query logic, ZPC determines that the custom policy has changed and closes all existing alerts. It generates new alerts based on the new custom policy query logic. To edit a custom security policy:
- Go to **Policies**.
- Click the **Actions** icon for the custom policy you want to edit.
- Click **Edit**.
[See image.](#action-edit-image)
- On the **Query Builder** tab, edit the query. To learn how to use the query builder, see [Creating Custom Security Policies](/zpc/creating-custom-security-policies).
- When you are done editing the query, click **Test Run**.
- Click **Accept and Proceed**.
- On the **Remediation Procedure** tab, click **Add Remediation Procedure**.
- Enter the remediation procedure in Markdown, then click **Save**.
- On the **Recommendations** tab, click **Add Recommendations**.
- Enter the recommendation in Markdown, then click **Save**.
- Click **Next.**
- Edit any of the following fields:
- **Policy Name**: The name of the security policy.
- **Policy Description**: The description of the policy.
- **Policy Severity**: Static value signaling the severity of policy failure. The value can be Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
- **Alert Description**: The description of the alert.
- **Threat Category**: The threat category to which the policy belongs.
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: The link to the technique on the MITRE ATT&CK website.
- **Compliance**: The compliance benchmark associated with the policy.
To enter compliance details, the query logic must be focused on assets and the asset type predicate has to be defined.
- **Domain**: The compliance benchmark domain associated with the policy.
- **Control Section**: The control section associated with the compliance benchmark domain of the policy.
- Click **Save Changes**.
