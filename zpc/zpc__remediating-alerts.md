You can manually remediate cloud alerts triggered for policy violations. You can remediate single alert, multiple alerts, bulk alerts, or all alerts triggered for a specific policy violation.
Ensure that write access is enabled for the cloud account to allow remediation. To learn more, see [Configuring Write Access for an AWS Cloud Account](/zpc/configuring-write-access-aws-cloud-account).
You can only remediate alerts with an *Open* status or alerts whose remediation status is *Failure*.
