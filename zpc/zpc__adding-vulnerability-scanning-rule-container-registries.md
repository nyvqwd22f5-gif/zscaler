You can add a vulnerability scanning rule and set up a schedule for the scan to run at regular intervals. ZPC scans the container images within the selected container registries based on the schedule and displays the scan results on the Vulnerability Management page. To learn more, see [About Vulnerability Management](/zpc/about-vulnerability-management). You can also get detailed insights of the findings on the [vulnerability dashboard](/zpc/viewing-vulnerability-dashboard).
Prerequisites
You must first onboard your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud accounts. To learn more, see [About Onboarding Cloud Accounts](/zpc/about-onboarding-cloud-accounts). After onboarding the accounts, you must configure the vulnerability integration for the required accounts before adding a scanning rule. To learn more, see [About Vulnerability Integrations](/zpc/about-vulnerability-integrations).

- Select the **Age of the Images for Scan** from the drop-down menu.
The repositories contain several image tags. You can select specific images that were added or updated during a particular duration (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months) so the scanning is triggered for images within that duration.
