You can download, edit, or delete the trusted IP list you've created. You can edit the name of the trusted IP list, associated cloud resources, or upload a new IP list. If you delete a trusted IP list, ZPC inventories and public exposure indicators are updated and all the associated cloud resources are viewed as publicly exposed security risks.
The trusted IP changes take up to 12 to 16 hours to reflect across the ZPC modules.
Uploading a new trusted IP list file overrides the existing file and affects the ZPC inventories, public exposure indicators, and public exposure alerts.
