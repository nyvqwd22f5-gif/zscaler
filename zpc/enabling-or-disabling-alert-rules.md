While adding an alert rule, you can also configure alert notifications. After the configuration, you must enable the alert rule, which allows ZPC to send notifications by email to specific recipients, or to third-party tools based on the notification channel you've selected. To learn more, see [About Alert Rules](/zpc/about-alert-rules).
You can initially configure the alert rule and notification, but enable the notification at a later point in time.
ZPC sends alert notifications only when you've enabled the alert rule.
To enable or disable an alert rule:
- In the left-side navigation, select **Alerts**.
- On the **Alerts** page, click the **Notifications** tab.
The list of alert rules is displayed.
