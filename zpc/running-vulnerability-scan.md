While you can configure the vulnerability scanning rules and schedule the scan to run at a specific date and time, you can also perform a vulnerability scan at any point in time. For example, you may want to immediately monitor specific container images or cloud workloads for any known vulnerabilities and check their security posture.
To perform a vulnerability scan immediately:
- Go to **Cloud Posture** > **Vulnerability Management**.
- On the **Vulnerability Management** page, select the **Scanning Rules** tab.
- Click the **Scan** icon to run the scan immediately.

- A confirmation message appears. Click **Confirm** to continue with scanning.

The status of the previous scan should be displayed as *Completed* before you trigger another scan on the specific container images. If a scan is in progress, then the next scan will be queued and executed after the current scan is completed.
