A message appears indicating that the role is updated successfully.
Deleting a Custom Role
You can delete a custom role when required. If the role is associated with a group, then you need to assign a different role (custom or predefined) to the group and then proceed to delete the role.
You cannot delete [predefined roles](/zpc/about-roles).
To delete a custom role:
- Go to **Administration** > **Role Management**.
- On the **Role Management** page, click the **Delete** icon for the custom role that you want to delete.
