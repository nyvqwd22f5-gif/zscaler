Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) enables you to integrate the vulnerability management for your Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud accounts. The integration allows ZPC to scan the Windows and Linux cloud workloads for known security vulnerabilities and display the scan results in the ZPC Admin Portal, so you can remediate the vulnerabilities.
The AWS cloud workload scan supports both AWS-managed and customer-managed encryption. However, to support AWS-managed encryption, at least one customer-managed key should be present in the region.
ZPC supports the vulnerability scanning of AWS cloud workloads located in the following regions:

Prerequisites
You must first onboard your AWS cloud accounts before configuring specific accounts and organizations for vulnerability scanning. To learn more, see [Onboarding an Amazon Web Services Account](/zpc/onboarding-amazon-web-services-account).
To integrate the vulnerability management for AWS workloads:
- Go to **Administration** >** Container Registries & Workloads**.
[See image](#cloudworkload).
- Click **Add Integration**.
- Under **General Information**:
- For **Vulnerability Scanning Type**, select **Cloud Workloads**.
- For **Cloud Type**, select **Amazon Web Services**.
[See image](#platform).
- Click **Next**.
- Under **Account Selection**:
- **Accounts**: Select the individual accounts that must be configured for scanning. Use the **Search** field to search for specific accounts in the list.
- **Organizations**: Select the accounts within a specific organization that must be configured for scanning.
[See image](#accounts).
- Click **Finish**.
A message is displayed indicating that the vulnerability management integration is successful. You can set up the vulnerability scanning rule and schedule the scan to run at regular intervals.
