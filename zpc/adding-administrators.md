You can configure as many administrator accounts as necessary. For each administrator, you can choose a single group or multiple groups. [Groups](/zpc/about-groups) are associated with specific roles and business units (scope).
Administrators who are part of multiple groups can [switch between groups](/zpc/about-groups#switchgroups) to access different roles in the ZPC Admin Portal. To learn more, [About Roles](/zpc/about-roles).
Zscaler recommends adding groups before adding administrators, because you must assign a group for each administrator that you create. To learn more, see [Adding a Group](/zwp/adding-group).
