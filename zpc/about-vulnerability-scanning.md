Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) scans your cloud workloads and container registries for vulnerabilities that could be a security threat. You can create scan rules and schedule the scan to run at regular intervals to proactively monitor your cloud resources. This helps you to quickly identify vulnerabilities and take the necessary remediation steps to maintain the security posture of your cloud environment. To learn more, see [About Vulnerability Management](/zpc/about-vulnerability-management).
The ZPC vulnerability scanning feature includes the following benefits and enables you to:
- Create custom vulnerability scanning rules and set up a schedule to run these scans.
- Choose to scan specific cloud workloads or container registries based on your organization's requirement.
- Access the vulnerability dashboard in the ZPC Admin Portal to assess the vulnerabilities and impacted resources.
- Evaluate the overall effectiveness of your security measures implemented in your organization.
- Take a proactive approach to protecting sensitive data and maintaining the security posture of your cloud workload.
- Maintain standard cybersecurity compliance and regulations.
ZPC performs vulnerability scanning on:
- **Container Registries**: Scans the container images within the container registries of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to detect known vulnerabilities. To learn more, see [Adding a Vulnerability Scanning Rule for Container Registries](/zpc/adding-vulnerability-scanning-rule-container-registries).
- **Cloud Workloads**: Scans the cloud workloads within AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud environment to detect known vulnerabilities. To learn more, see [Adding a Vulnerability Scanning Rule for Cloud Workloads](/zpc/adding-vulnerability-scanning-rule-cloud-workloads).
Vulnerability Scanning Types
ZPC performs two types of scanning:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scanning**: Set up a scan schedule (daily or weekly) and run the scan at regular intervals.
- **Event-Driven Vulnerability Scanning**: Whenever a new container image is added to the AWS container registry and once ZPC receives a notification that the image is added, ZPC triggers a vulnerability scan immediately and does not wait for the scan schedule.
Currently, event-driven scans are supported only for AWS elastic container registries (ECR). To scan the images using an event-driven scan, ensure a vulnerability scanning rule is added for the repository to which the image is being added or pushed.
