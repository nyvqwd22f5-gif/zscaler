Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) enables you to integrate the vulnerability management for your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) workloads. The integration allows ZPC to scan the Windows and Linux GCP cloud workloads for known security vulnerabilities and display the scan results in the ZPC Admin Portal, so you can investigate and remediate the vulnerabilities.
ZPC does not support the vulnerability scanning of GCP workloads that are encrypted with Customer Supplied Encryption Key (CSEK).
ZPC supports the vulnerability scanning of GCP cloud workloads located in the following regions:
- [Supported Regions](#regions)
Prerequisites
You must first onboard your GCP cloud accounts before enabling the specific accounts for vulnerability scanning. To learn more, see [Onboarding a Google Cloud Platform Account](/zpc/onboarding-google-cloud-platform-account).
To integrate the vulnerability management for GCP cloud workloads:
- Go to **Administration** >** Container Registries & Workloads**.
- Click **Add Integration**.
[See image.](#addgcp)
- Under **General Information**:
- For **Vulnerability Scanning Type**, select **Cloud Workloads**.
- For **Cloud Type**, select **Google Cloud**.
[See image.](#selectcloud)
- Click **Next**.
- Under **Account Selection**, click the **Organizations** tab and select the accounts within a specific organization that must be configured for scanning.
[See image.](#selectorg)
- Click **Finish**.
A message is displayed indicating that the vulnerability management integration is successful. You can set up the vulnerability scanning rule and schedule the scan to run at regular intervals. To learn more, see [Adding a Vulnerability Scanning Rule for Cloud Workloads](/zpc/adding-vulnerability-scanning-rule-cloud-workloads).
