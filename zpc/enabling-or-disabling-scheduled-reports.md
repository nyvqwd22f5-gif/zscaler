After you've created a specific schedule to generate the compliance or alert reports, you can choose to enable or disable the schedule. This option allows you to pause the report from being generated and sent to the recipient for a specific duration.
By default, the schedule is enabled when you first create a report schedule.
To enable or disable a schedule:
- Go to **Administration** > **Scheduled Reports**.
- Click the toggle under the **Status** column to enable or disable a schedule.

A confirmation message appears indicating that the schedule is enabled or disabled depending on the action. For example, the following message is displayed when you disable a schedule.
