ZPC groups common threats into different threat categories based on various attack techniques. The policy violations are assigned a specific threat category and a severity level, which enables you to analyze the issue and take the necessary action.
ZPC defines the following threat categories:
| **Threat Category ** | **Description** |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Account Takeover | Suspicious and unusual activity patterns that do not resemble normal activity and suggest an account takeover |
| Authentication Misconfiguration | Bad practice or misconfiguration of authentication settings that lead to easy access of important resources resulting in high security risk |
| Crypto mining | Setup and activities suspected to be related to crypto mining |
| Dormant Accounts | User accounts that are not used over a long period of time |
| External Exposure | Publicly exposed resources |
| Multilayer Attack Paths | Correlated activities and settings that compose a complete attack vector into your system |
| Permission Misconfiguration | Bad practice or risky permission settings |
| Privilege Escalation | Configuration issues that directly or indirectly allow for privilege escalation (e.g., users with basic permissions implement various techniques to gain administrator privileges) |
| Ransomware | Improper configurations and suspicious activities that indicate a potential ransomware attack. |
| Reconnaissance and Evasion | Activities and configuration changes that often occur during reconnaissance and evasion attempts during an attack |
| Security Events and Attack Vector | Alerts related to security events such as suspicious user activity, and advanced attack vectors that allow for high-risk exploitation of the system |
| Security Exposure | Alerts related to security exposure, such as bad configurations, permissions, etc. |
| Service Misconfiguration | Services that are badly configured leading to advanced attacks |
| Stale Data and Assets | Images and data that are stored for a very long time with no changes |
| Suspicious Activity | Tracking uncommon risky activities that may indicate an attack |
