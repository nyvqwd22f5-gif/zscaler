Signing In Using SSO
When you set up the IdP configuration, all the users in a particular tenant of your organization can log in using SSO.
If your account is configured to use single sign-on (SSO):
- Enter your **Login ****ID**.
- Click **Next**.
You are redirected to your IdP's login page.
- Log in with your credentials.
If you are logged in successfully, you are redirected back to the ZPC Admin Portal. To learn more, see [Configuring SAML for SSO](/zpc/configuring-saml-sso).
Signing In as Breakglass Admin
If the IdP is enabled for your organization but you're not able to log in because of IdP issues, then you can log in as Breakglass Admin directly.
- On the Login page, click **Sign in as Breakglass Admin.**
- Log in with your credentials.
The administrator can log in using the Breakglass Admin option directly (with local credentials) even when the IdP is enabled.
Enabling JIT Provisioning
You can enable Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning to allow ZPC to automatically provision a user on log-in. An IdP-initiated login is required for ZPC to retrieve user information from IdP and provision a user in ZPC. To learn more, see [Adding an IdP Configuration](/zpc/adding-idp-configuration).
JIT does not work with SP-initiated login.
[]When you log in for the first time, the ZPC Admin Portal displays the EUSA. Accept the EUSA. If you click **Cancel**, the ZPC Admin Portal logs you out automatically. You can read the [full EUSA](https://www.zscaler.com/legal/end-user-subscription-agreement?_gl=1*18c1oa5*_ga*MjEwNjUxNjQxNi4xNjUzOTY5NjU3*_ga_10SPJ4YJL9*MTY1NDE0MTg2MC4xMy4xLjE2NTQxNDIyMTQuNDM.&_ga=2.38265571.1184737641.1653969657-2106516416.1653969657) any time.
