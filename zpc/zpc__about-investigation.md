Your cloud infrastructure might be deployed across multiple cloud service providers and is onboarded on Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC). Depending on the number of cloud accounts you have onboarded, ZPC offers insights on your cloud assets and cloud identities using alerts generated by security policies.
You might want to glean certain information about your cloud deployment's posture without having to create alerts or filter information on the dashboard. For example, you want to look at all S3 buckets that were generated in the past week by a human identity. You can leverage ZPC's Investigation feature to effectively parse such information, and based on the result, save the investigation or create a custom security policy.
The Investigation feature provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Run queries on the data collected by ZPC and gain more insight into your cloud deployment's security posture.
- Tune queries, run them multiple times, inspect results, and then discard or save the queries, either as investigation queries or custom security policies.
