Alert rules define the criteria for generating an alert notification. The criteria could be the occurrence of specific security events, such as policy violations or misconfigurations in your cloud resources.
You can [configure alert rules](/zpc/adding-alert-rules) and notifications and send alert notifications to recipients or [third-party tools](/zpc/about-third-party-integrations) for further investigation and remediation. To learn more, see [About Alerts](/zpc/about-alerts).
