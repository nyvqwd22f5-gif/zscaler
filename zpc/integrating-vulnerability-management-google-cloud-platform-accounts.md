Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) enables you to integrate vulnerability management for your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts. This integration allows you to scan the container images in the Google Container Registries (GCR) and Google Artifact Registry (GAR) for known security vulnerabilities and view the scan results in the ZPC Admin Portal, so you can investigate and remediate the vulnerabilities. To learn more, see [About Vulnerability Management](/zpc/about-vulnerability-management) and [About the Vulnerability Dashboard](/zpc/about-vulnerability-dashboard).
Prerequisites
You must first onboard your GCP cloud accounts before configuring specific accounts for vulnerability scanning. To learn more, see [Onboarding a Google Cloud Platform Account](/zpc/onboarding-google-cloud-platform-account).
Integrating Vulnerability Management for GCP Accounts
To integrate vulnerability management for specific GCP accounts:
- Go to **Administration **>** Container Registries & Workloads**.
- Click **Add Integration**.
[See image.](#add-gcp)
- Under **General Information**:
- For **Vulnerability Scanning Type**, select **Cloud Container Registries**.
- For **Cloud Type**, select **Google Cloud Platform**.
[See image.](#gcp-platform)
- Click **Next**.
- Under **Account Selection**:
- **Accounts**: Select the individual accounts that must be configured for scanning. Use the **Search** field to search for specific accounts in the list.
- **Organizations**: Select the accounts within a specific organization that must be configured for scanning. Click the **Expand **icon ( ![Click the icon to view the list of registries](/downloads/zpc/container-registries-workloads/vulnerability-integrations/cloud-container-registries/integrating-vulnerability-management-google-artifact-registry/zpc-arrow-icon.png)
) to see the list of accounts and the associated registries.

- Click **Finish**.
The integrated GCP accounts are displayed on the **Container Registries & Workloads** page.
You can configure the vulnerability scanning rule and schedule the scan to run at regular intervals. To learn more, see [Adding a Vulnerability Scanning Rule for Container Registries](/zpc/adding-vulnerability-scanning-rule-container-registries).
