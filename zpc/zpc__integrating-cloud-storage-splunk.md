Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) has designed the data logs to conform with the [Splunk Common Information Model (CIM)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Overview). This model is used to normalize data in a standard format, so it can be exchanged between software solutions.
After you integrate ZPC with the cloud storage service (Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) for collecting data logs, you can choose to integrate the cloud storage service with Splunk, so the data logs can be transferred to Splunk for data analysis, auditing, reporting, or threat detection.
To learn how to integrate your cloud storage with Splunk, see:
