Microsoft announced the End-of-Support (EOS) for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020. Zscaler Client Connector will continue to support Windows 7 until 2021, i.e., 12 months from Microsoft’s EOS date. This means that any fundamental issues with Windows 7 itself cannot be addressed by Zscaler, and you might be required to upgrade to a later version.
