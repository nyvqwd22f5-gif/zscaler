Versions of Zscaler Client Connector 2.1 and earlier downloaded the configured SSL inspection certificate from a cloud-based content delivery network (CDN). While version 2.1 is no longer supported, this notice is to inform you that as of September 1, 2023, the certificate download function will be removed.
Devices still running version 2.1 or earlier will continue to function, however if the SSL certificate is not trusted by the device, it will not be downloaded.
Ensure you're running the latest supported versions of Zscaler Client Connector. To learn more, see [Supported Versions](/eos-eol/supported-versions).
