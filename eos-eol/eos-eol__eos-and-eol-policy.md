PDF: https://help.zscaler.com/pdf/com/en/1269766.pdf

This policy is effective as of August 1st, 2017.
Zscaler services and products (collectively the “Products”) are continuously improved and earlier versions of the Products may reach their End-of-Life (EOL) as new versions of the Products supersede them. This policy is a guide for customers and partners regarding the milestones and timeframes for when a Product reaches EOL. This policy is provided to assist customers and partners in planning and successfully transitioning to current versions of the Products or new Products, and covers the following three areas:
- Zscaler SaaS Products
- Zscaler Software Products
- Zscaler Hardware
Zscaler SaaS Products
Zscaler SaaS Products are upgraded regularly with the current version replacing the previous version in the Zscaler cloud. Zscaler upgrades all customers together in its cloud, so all customers maintain the most current supported version. However, a specific SaaS Product might transition through milestones to its EOL.
| SaaS Products Milestones | Timeframe | Description |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------- |
| End-of-Sale (EOS) | Zscaler notification at least 90 days before EOS | SaaS Product is no longer available for new orders. However, the SaaS Product may be renewed to extend an existing contract or to add more users through its EOL date. Zscaler will continue to provide support for the Product until the EOL for the Product. |
| End-of-Life (EOL) | EOL at least 1 year after the EOS date | After EOL, the SaaS Product will no longer be available and customers with existing contracts that extend beyond the EOL date will be offered either an upgrade path or replacement or Zscaler will support the current Product until the end of the then-current contract term without renewal. |
Zscaler Software Products
Over time, Zscaler Software Products that are installed on user devices may be superseded by newer versions or Products, and the latest supported versions are published for customers and partners at [Supported Versions](/eos-eol/announcements/supported-versions). Customers and partners are encouraged to use the latest supported versions.
Zscaler Software Support Policy
In general, Zscaler supports the latest Software version and the two previous versions for each Software Product. In some cases, Zscaler may designate another version as a supported version and will note this at [Supported Versions](/eos-eol/announcements/supported-versions). Software Product [Supported Versions](/eos-eol/announcements/supported-versions) are eligible for patch and maintenance upgrades until the EOL of the Product.
Zscaler Support will request that customers and partners upgrade to a [Supported Version](/eos-eol/announcements/supported-versions) before beginning troubleshooting. Support services transfer to the supported versions of the Software.
In some cases, an organization may elect to use a Software Product version that is no longer recommended or supported by Zscaler. Zscaler will provide information regarding the status of Software versions at [Supported Versions](/eos-eol/announcements/supported-versions) so that customers and partners can make informed choices about which version to use in their organization.
| Software Products Milestones | Timeframe | Description |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| End-of-Sale (EOS) | Zscaler notification at least 60 days before EOS | EOS Software Products are no longer available for purchase or download by customers or partners. Supported Versions of EOS Software Products are eligible for patch and maintenance upgrades until the EOL of the Product. |
| End-of-Life (EOL) | EOL at least 6 months after the EOS date | After EOL, the Software Product is no longer eligible for patch or maintenance upgrades or support, and no longer has any supported versions.Existing contracts for Software Products that extend beyond the EOL date will be offered either an upgrade path to a replacement Software Product or Zscaler will support the EOL Software Product through the end of the then-current contract term without renewal. |
Zscaler Hardware
To maintain cloud standards and support new technologies for customers and partners that lease hardware as part of the Zscaler solution, Zscaler initiates the replacement of Zscaler-owned hardware, whether it is in a third party datacenter or on-premises at a customer or partner site. This is called Hardware Refresh. Hardware Refresh is a necessary component of maintaining the operation of Zscaler Products and is done in coordination with customers and partners as part of the Zscaler Hardware Refresh Lifecycle described below. Customers and partners are notified of hardware refresh dates according the following table.
| Hardware Refresh Cycle | Timeframe | Description |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Refresh Date | In most cases, about 5 years from the subscription start date for the Zscaler-owned hardware | The Refresh Date is the date by which Zscaler-owned hardware is to be replaced. Usually this is about 5 years from the subscription start date; however, Zscaler may refresh hardware at any time to support new innovations. |
| Refresh Notification | Zscaler notification at least 90 days before Refresh Date | Refresh Notification is a communication from Zscaler to customers and partners with the recommended Zscaler-owned new hardware shipment date and prior hardware return date. The specific shipment and return dates are then determined in consultation with the customer or partners. In some cases, upgrades may be expedited in order to support new functionality. |
| Refresh Shipment Date | Date new Zscaler-owned hardware is shipped | Date new Zscaler-owned equipment is shipped. It is recommended that the Refresh Shipment Date be prior to the Refresh Date of the hardware to be replaced. |
| Hardware Return Date | Unless otherwise agreed to by Zscaler, a maximum of 90 days after the Refresh Shipment Date | The Hardware Return Date is the date by which the replaced hardware is due to be received by Zscaler. Zscaler Service Level Agreements (SLAs) will not be available to Products running on hardware being used after its Hardware Return Date. At Zscaler’s option, hardware not returned to Zscaler within 90 days from the Hardware Return Date may be subject to additional asset recovery mitigation. |
| End-of-Life (EOL) | EOL 1 year after Refresh Date | Specific hardware may have an EOL date, which is the latest date the hardware can be used in production. SLAs are not available to Products running on hardware being used after its EOL date. Unless there is an urgent reason to refresh sooner, the EOL date will be 1 year after the Refresh Date. |
General Disclaimer for All Products
SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE DETAILS WHERE USE OF THE PRODUCTS IS PERMITTED AFTER AN EOL DATE, ZSCALER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES IF CUSTOMER USES THE PRODUCTS PAST THE EOL DATE, OR THE HARDWARE RETURN DATE FOR HARDWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DEGRADATION OR INTERRUPTION OF THE PRODUCTS, AND SUCH USE PAST THE EOL DATE OR HARDWARE RETURN DATE SHALL RESULT IN THE INVALIDATION OF ANY AND ALL SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND SERVICE CREDITS FOR THE PRODUCTS.
