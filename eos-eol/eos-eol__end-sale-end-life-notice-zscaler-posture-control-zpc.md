Zscaler is announcing the End-of-Sale (EOS) and End-of-Life (EOL) dates for Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC).
| EOS Date | EOL Date |
| -------- | -------- |
| March 15, 2025 | March 15, 2026 |
As of March 15, 2025, licenses for new ZPC subscriptions will no longer be available for purchase. The ZPC service and all existing tenants will be supported until the EOL of ZPC planned for March 15, 2026.
Next Steps
If you are using ZPC, you should consider a migration plan to [Zscaler Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)](/dspm), which offers data security posture management for your public clouds and provides data classification in addition to posture management over cloud data stores.
Customers seeking the migration to DSPM path will be getting a complimentary overlap period of 2 months leveraging DSPM parallel to ZPC, after which the remainder of the ZPC subscription term will be replaced by DSPM subscription at no extra charge.
Contact [Zscaler Support](/phone-support) to devise a migration plan.
