Zscaler will end support of 3DES for SSL after the 5.6 release. If you have clients using 3DES for SSL, ensure that they change it to AES256-GCM-SHA384, AES128-GCM-SHA256, AES256-SHA, or AES128-SHA by October 31, 2018.
If you do not change it, clients using 3DES will be unable to connect to websites when 3DES support is ended.
If you need help changing your configuration or if you have additional questions or concerns, contact Zscaler Support via the Support link in the Admin Portal.
