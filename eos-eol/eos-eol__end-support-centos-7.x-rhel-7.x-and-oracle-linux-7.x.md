Zscaler will no longer support App Connectors and Private Service Edges running on CentOS 7.x, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x (RHEL 7.x), and Oracle Linux 7.x after March 31, 2025. Customers currently using CentOS 7.x, RHEL 7.x, Oracle Linux 7.x, and the EL7 ZPA repository will need to migrate to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 or later and the EL9 ZPA repository after this date.
