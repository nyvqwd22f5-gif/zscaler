Zscaler is announcing the End-of-Sale (EOS) and End-of-Life (EOL) dates for Zscaler SecureAgent for iOS. SecureAgent on iOS uses an on-demand IPSec VPN tunnel as its primary method to forward traffic to the Zscaler cloud from an Apple iOS device. This also includes agent-less IPSec-based deployment using advanced API-based integration with MDM partners, such as MobileIron and AirWatch.
| EOS Date | EOL Date |
| -------- | -------- |
| March 1, 2017 | November 30, 2017 |
As of March 1, 2017, user licenses for new deployments of iOS devices with Zscaler SecureAgent for iOS are not available for purchase.
Existing deployments of iOS with Global HTTP Proxy without using IPSec tunnels will be supported until EOL of Zscaler SecureAgent for iOS on November 30, 2017.
Next Steps
If you are using SecureAgent on iOS devices with IPSec tunnels, you must plan a migration to Zscaler Client Connector for iOS. You must migrate to Zscaler Client Connector on iOS by November 30, 2017, as Zscaler SecureAgent for iOS will be EOL and no longer supported.
Additional Information
If you have additional questions, contact Zscaler Support via the Support link in the Admin Portal.
