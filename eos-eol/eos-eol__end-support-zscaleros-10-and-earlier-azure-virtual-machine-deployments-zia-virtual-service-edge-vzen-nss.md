Azure Virtual Machine deployments with ZscalerOS version 10 and earlier are no longer supported for ZIA Virtual Service Edges, VZENs, and NSS as of June 24, 2022.
If your organization is running an Azure Virtual Machine deployment with ZscalerOS version 10 and earlier, migrate to ZscalerOS version 24 or higher by June 24, 2022, to ensure service continuity. No action is required for customers with virtual machines (VMs) on AWS or ESXi; these VMs are being upgraded remotely and automatically.
