This policy is effective as of January 31, 2025.
What is Long-Term Support?
In addition to supporting the current and previous two versions of Zscaler Client Connector, Zscaler now offers long-term support for [specific versions](/eos-eol/supported-versions) of Zscaler Client Connector for each platform. Long-Term Support (LTS) is an existing selected version of Zscaler Client Connector whose support continues for up to 12 months, regardless of the current supported versions. LTS releases exclude new features or functionality and only contain critical bug fixes and security updates.
Starting from January 31, 2025, the most widely adopted version of Zscaler Client Connector will be nominated as the LTS version, and support for that version will continue for the next 12 months, after which a new version will be selected to be the new LTS version.
Which platforms does LTS apply to?
Currently, LTS only applies to Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. As Zscaler Client Connector for iOS, and Android on ChromeOS are typically deployed from their respective app stores, it is not possible to maintain multiple versions.
Why is the LTS version needed?
As Zscaler Client Connector is a widely adopted security solution, it is critical that newer versions are adopted. Zscaler recognizes that the frequency of updates might not apply to all deployments. Some environments require more strict and long-term change controls, which can be challenging to comply with, while still running a supported version. By maintaining a version for a longer period of time, while still ensuring security and bug fixes, Zscaler customers can have a stable version to run without needing to continue updating for new releases with functionality they might not need.
Is this the recommended version?
In general, no. LTS is intended to give Zscaler customers a stable version to run for an extended period of time. The recommended version is typically the latest version that has reached General Availability (GA). If your environment has a requirement for longer change cycles which prevent more frequent updates to GA versions, then the LTS version would be recommended for you.
How will changes to future LTS versions happen?
Two months prior to the next LTS version, the projected next version will be announced, giving time for customers to migrate to the latest LTS version.
As LTS is chosen from existing versions, the next LTS will be a version that is already available for tenants.
