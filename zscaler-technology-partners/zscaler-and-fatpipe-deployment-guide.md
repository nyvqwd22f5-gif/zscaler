The Zscaler and FatPipe Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the FatPipe platform.
Zscaler secures direct-to-internet connections and delivers a fast user experience — without backhauling and without the cost and complexity of duplicating the appliance security stack at each location. Zscaler, in combination with your FatPipe SD-WAN, reduces MPLS costs and provides a fast and secure user experience.
