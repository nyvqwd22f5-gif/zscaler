The Zscaler and Votiro Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with the Votiro Cloud platform.
Votiro Cloud is a Zero Trust Content Security platform that proactively detects and disarms known and unknown file-borne threats, while also providing actionable threat analytics. ZIA is a secure internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Together, Zscaler Isolation and Votiro Cloud enable users to access, view, and download the content they need—seamlessly and without risk— to improve the security of traffic passing through the ZIA platform.
Customers use ZIA and the associated services to ensure that no malicious files are downloaded onto managed endpoints. In addition, customers use Zscaler Isolation to secure access to private or SaaS applications accessed from unmanaged devices.
