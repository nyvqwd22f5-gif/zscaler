The Zscaler and Tufin Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Tufin SecureWorks+ platform.
Tufin SecureTrack+ centralizes network security policy management, risk mitigation, and compliance monitoring across firewalls, NGFWs, routers, switches, SDN, and hybrid clouds. SecureTrack+ provides holistic visibility and consolidates the management of your network segmentation policies across on-premises and cloud.
SecureTrack+ communicates with ZIA using a REST API. You must create an API Admin with limited permissions on the Zscaler side.
