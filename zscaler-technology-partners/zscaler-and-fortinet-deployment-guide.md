The Zscaler and Fortinet Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) with the Fortinet platform.
This document provides UI examples for configuring ZIA and Fortinet. This guide is intended for proof-of-concept topologies and demos, evaluating interoperability, and joint integration. This guide should not be used to configure either vendor platform for production use.
Zscaler's UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies. Zscaler UVM offers the following preconfigured Fortinet Lacework connectors:
- Lacework: Retrieves information about the discovered devices, including their attributes and states.
- Lacework Compliance AWS: Retrieves vulnerability data related to devices, including matched device details.
- Lacework Compliance GCP: Retrieves vulnerability data related to devices, including matched device details.
