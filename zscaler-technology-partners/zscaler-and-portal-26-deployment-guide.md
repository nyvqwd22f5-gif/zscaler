The Zscaler and Portal26 Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Portal26.
Portal26 facilitates user data acquisition through approaches tailored to prevalent network security solutions. For organizations using Zscaler, Portal26 enables the seamless transmission of prompt data through ZIA to an incident receiver hosted by Portal26. This process ensures a secure and streamlined transfer of data, allowing Portal26 to delve into user interactions effectively.
The Zscaler Incident Receiver is a tool that allows you to receive information about DLP policy violations securely. It can run on an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS), on an Azure VM, or on-premises. The Zscaler service sends information about policy violations via ICAP to the Incident Receiver. This tool sends the policy-violating content and a JSON file containing the metadata for the inline web and CASB DLP policy scan (e.g., the URL, Collaborators, DLP dictionaries, DLP engines, etc.).
