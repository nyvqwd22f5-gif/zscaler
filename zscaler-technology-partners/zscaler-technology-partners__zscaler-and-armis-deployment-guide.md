The Zscaler and Armis Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM), and Zscaler Deception with the Armis Centrix platform.
The Armis Centrix platform is powered by the Armis AI-driven Asset Intelligence Engine, which sees, secures, protects, and manages billions of assets around the world in real time.
The Zscaler and Armis integration periodically connects to the Zscaler cloud and retrieves asset details on devices connected via the Zscaler Client Connector. The Zscaler platform sends continuous traffic logs to the integration for retrieving traffic and service metadata.
Zscaler's UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies. Zscaler UVM offers the following preconfigured Armis connectors:
- Armis Devices: Retrieves information about the discovered devices, including their attributes and states.
- Armis Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE): Retrieves vulnerability data related to devices, including matched device details.
The integration between Armis and Deception further enhances customer capabilities by leveraging profile data in Deception-managed devices as a data source. The information is correlated with other data sources.
