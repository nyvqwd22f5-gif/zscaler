The Zscaler and SentinelOne Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure integrations between the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) and the SentinelOne Singularity Platform to deliver end-to-end visibility, threat detection, and automated response across endpoint, network, and cloud environments.
SentinelOne Singularity Platform unifies and extends detection, response, and automation across multiple security layers—providing security teams with centralized enterprise visibility, advanced analytics, and AI-powered actions. With Singularity, customers can leverage integrated and proactive security measures to defend the entire technology stack, making it easier for security analysts to identify and stop attacks in progress before they impact the business.
Enhanced with Purple AI and Hyperautomation, the joint solution introduces AI-assisted investigation and autonomous remediation capabilities. Purple AI enables natural-language-driven threat detection, contextual summarization, and guided investigation directly from the SentinelOne Management Console. Hyperautomation extends this power by orchestrating policy changes across Zscaler and SentinelOne—accelerating response and minimizing analyst workload.
Together, Zscaler and SentinelOne enable unified visibility, automated triage, and policy-based remediation to secure users and devices—delivering scalable, adaptive, and intelligent zero trust protection across the enterprise.
