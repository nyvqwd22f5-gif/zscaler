The Zscaler and LogRhythm Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the LogRhythm platform.
LogRhythm SIEM streamlines incident investigation and response through a visual analyst experience. Analysts see an entire security story about a user or host helping your team quickly investigate and respond to threats. LogRhythm SIEM provides the details to investigate and shut down attacks before severe damage occurs.
Zscaler sends logs from ZIA to LogRhythm via traditional syslog or a cloud-to-cloud log transport mechanism. The traditional syslog transport requires deploying an NSS virtual machine (VM) that pulls logs securely from Zscaler Nanolog stores and sends them to an on-premises SIEM via TCP.
