The Zscaler and DataBee Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the DataBee Hive platform.
The DataBee and Zscaler integration is for compliance tracking. DataBee uses Zscaler APIs and logs to gain visibility into users staying compliant with corporate policy. One example is highlighting non-compliant users who turn off the Zscaler Client Connector.
The Zscaler Client Connector is a lightweight agent that encrypts and forwards user traffic to the security cloud. In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, you can define policies that control how a device forwards traffic to the Zscaler service and what can be accessed from a device.
This document details the steps needed to integrate the DataBee Hive platform to fetch a list of enrolled devices within the organization using the Zscaler Client Connector API.
