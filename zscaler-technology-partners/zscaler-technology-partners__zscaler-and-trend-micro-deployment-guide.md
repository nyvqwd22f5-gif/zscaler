The Zscaler and Trend Micro Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with the Trend Micro Vision One Security Playbooks.
The ZIA and Trend Micro integration supports adaptive policy enforcement by leveraging risk insights from Trend Vision One to control users' internet access in real time via ZIA. When a user exceeds a defined risk threshold, Trend Vision One automatically triggers an action to add them to a ZIA Restricted User Group. ZIA then applies predefined policies, such as limiting access to specific websites, blocking downloads, or restricting cloud app usage.
The ZPA and Trend Micro integration enables organizations to dynamically restrict access to internal or private applications using risk insights from Trend Vision One. When a user’s Trend Micro calculated risk score exceeds a configured threshold, Trend Vision One can automatically place the user into a ZPA Restricted User Group through SCIM provisioning.
