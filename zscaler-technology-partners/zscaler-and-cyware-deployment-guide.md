The Zscaler and Cyware Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Cyware Threat Intelligence Exchange (CTIX) platform.
Zscaler works with the CTIX application in two ways:
- As an enrichment tool to enrich threat data such as hashes, domains, or URLs in the CTIX application.
- As an internal application in CTIX to support your organization’s security operations. The CTIX application can then send allowlisted and denylisted URLs to Zscaler.
