The Zscaler and Google Workspace Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with Google Workspace.
Zscaler and Google Workspace are a security partnership that enhances the security and control of data within the Google Workspace suite of applications. Zscaler provides a cloud-based security platform, while Google Workspace offers productivity and collaboration tools like Gmail, Drive, and Docs. Together, they offer features like zero trust access, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and security insights, making it easier for businesses to protect sensitive information within their Google Workspace environment.
ZIA provides visibility and security for Google SaaS applications with out-of-band Cloud Access Security Broker, SaaS Tenant Control, SaaS Security Management, Google Drive Labels, and Google Workspace to third-party Application Governance. This deployment guide outlines all Zscaler and Google Workspace-related integrations and key benefits.
