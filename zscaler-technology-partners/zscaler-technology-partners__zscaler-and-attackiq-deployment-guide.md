The Zscaler and AttackIQ Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with the AttackIQ platform.
AttackIQ emulates adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures, aligned to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and provides visibility into your security program performance with clear data-driven analysis and mitigation guidance.
The ZIA Recommended Policies Health Check template was created to provide a basic function check of a ZIA deployment for Windows assets protected by the Zscaler Client Connector and the Zscaler recommended policies exercising the ability to both detect and block adversarial behaviors.
