The Zscaler and Box Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) with the Box platform.
ZIA provides SaaS security using Zscaler's SaaS Security API to scan the Box datastores for malicious content and data protection. ZIA also provides complete security for clients whether they are in the corporate office or their home office. The ZDX service provides user-specific experience monitoring and visibility for the Box service to help organizations address any experience concerns or challenges.
