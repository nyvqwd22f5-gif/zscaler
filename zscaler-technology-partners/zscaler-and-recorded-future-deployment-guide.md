The Zscaler and Recorded Future Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Recorded Future platform.
The Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud combines persistent data collection, large-scale graph analysis, and analytical acumen to provide complete coverage of intelligence across adversaries, their infrastructure, and the organizations they target, empowering business and security leaders to act with speed and confidence.
The Recorded Future and Zscaler integration works by updating the blocklists on a Zscaler customer account. This happens through web APIs that connect the two platforms together. The integration is a Python script that can run on a server anywhere that has connectivity between the Recorded Future and Zscaler clouds.
