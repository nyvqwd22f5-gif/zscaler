The Zscaler and Living Security Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Living Security Human Risk Management Platform.
The Human Risk Management Platform uses your organization’s data from existing technology platforms to deliver unique, actionable insights to prioritize resources, focus efforts, and proactively decrease human risk.
Zscaler Cloud Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) allows you to stream logs from ZIA directly into a compatible cloud-based security information and event management (SIEM) system without deploying an NSS VM for Web or Firewall.
