The Zscaler and D3 Security Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler with the D3 Security's security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platform.
Zscaler's cloud-based security service platform establishes fast and secure connections to devices, regardless of the device's network, device, or location.
D3 Security's SOAR platform unifies security operations, ingests, normalizes, and prioritizes alerts from third-party tools, at scale.
By integrating D3 Security's SOAR with Zscaler, security teams can leverage the Zscaler and D3 SOAR integration for threat hunting, automating incident response, and orchestrating URL changes to allow and deny lists.
