The Zscaler and ForgeRock Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the ForgeRock platform.
ForgeRock uses the concept of a “Circle of Trust” to manage the relationship between Identity Providers (IdPs) and service providers (SPs). When configuring ForgeRock Access Management Single Sign-On using SAML v2.0, you can map accounts at the IdP to accounts at the SP, including mapping to an anonymous user. The IdP can then make assertions to the SP. The SP then consumes assertions from the IdP to make authorization decisions.
In this integration, ForgeRock is the IdP and Zscaler is the SP.
