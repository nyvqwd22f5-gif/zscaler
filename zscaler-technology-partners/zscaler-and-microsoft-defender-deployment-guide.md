The Zscaler and Microsoft Defender Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the Microsoft Defender endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform.
Microsoft 365 Defender leverages the Microsoft 365 security portfolio to automatically analyze threat data across domains, building a complete picture of each attack in a single dashboard. Microsoft Defender brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices (or endpoints).
Zscaler's integration leverages Microsoft Defender for Endpoint APIs to provide EDR visibility for Sandbox-detected malware. After it is configured, the Zscaler service calls the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint API and requests information for endpoints that were exposed to the malicious file.
