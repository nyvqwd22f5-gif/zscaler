The Zscaler and Fidelis Security Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features with Fidelis Network.
The integration allows Fidelis Network to ingest and analyze all generated ZIA data for improved threat hunting and alert workflows. Ingesting ZIA data helps Fidelis Network correlate events across multivendor environments and track adversarial movements across cloud, endpoint, and network.
