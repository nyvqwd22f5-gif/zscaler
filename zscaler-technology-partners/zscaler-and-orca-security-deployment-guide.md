The Zscaler and Orca Security Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) features with Orca Security Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP).
Zscaler UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies. Zscaler UVM offers the following preconfigured connectors for Orca Security:
- Orca Alerts
- Orca Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs)
- Orca Assets
- Orca Vulnerabilities
The steps in this guide outline how to start ingesting data from these sources, while also (optionally) combining Orca Vulnerabilities data with AWS EC2 tag information to provide a more contextualized and personalized risk assessment for your organization.
