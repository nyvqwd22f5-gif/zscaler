The Zscaler and Cisco SD-WAN Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with Cisco SD-WAN.
Cisco SD-WAN uses the Viptela/IOS XE and is a highly secure, cloud-scale architecture that is open, programmable, and scalable. Through the Catalyst SD-WAN Manager (formerly vManage), you can quickly establish an SD-WAN overlay fabric to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency.
ZIA is a secure internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Zscaler supports both Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunnels from edge devices to transport internet traffic that first traverses the ZIA node.
