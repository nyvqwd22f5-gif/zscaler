The Zscaler and Skybox Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with Skybox Security Policy Management (SPM).
The Skybox SPM platform lets organizations visualize and analyze hybrid, multi-cloud, and operational technology (OT) networks, providing full context and understanding of your attack surface. Skybox integration with Zscaler allows Skybox users to collect information from the Zscaler web firewall to be used in the Skybox SPM.
