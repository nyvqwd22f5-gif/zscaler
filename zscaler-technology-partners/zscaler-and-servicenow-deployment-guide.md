The Zscaler and ServiceNow Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) with the ServiceNow platform.
Zscaler provides a complete solution using ZIA for security and ZDX for user experience visibility. ZIA uses access control, identity control, SaaS security posture management, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and a SaaS Security API to scan the ServiceNow attachments for malicious content. The ZDX service provides user-specific experience monitoring and visibility to the ServiceNow service to address any user experience concerns or challenges. This guide covers the following:
- SaaS Identity Proxy
- Isolation
- SaaS Security Data Loss Prevention
- SaaS Security Malware Detection
- Cloud Application Access Control
- ZDX for ServiceNow
- Zscaler Cloud Protection (ZCP) ServiceNow Incident Creation
