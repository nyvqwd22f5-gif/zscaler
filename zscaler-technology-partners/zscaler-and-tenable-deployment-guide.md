The Zscaler UVM and Tenable Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler UVM to work with Tenable Vulernability Management.
Tenable Vulnerability Management is a leading-edge solution for modern vulnerability management, designed to help organizations identify, assess, and prioritize risks across their entire attack surface.
Zscaler’s Data Fabric and Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies.
This guide explains how to start ingesting data from these sources, while also (optionally) combining Tenable Vulnerability Management data with Zscaler Client Connector device information to provide a more contextualized and personalized risk assessment for your organization.
