The Zscaler and Okta Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Okta authentication.
Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity through the use of credentials and other additional identity factors. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the preferred authentication method for both ZIA and ZPA. This document shows how to configure Okta as the SAML identity provider (IdP). SAML allows Okta to authenticate a user and pass the authorization credentials to Zscaler services as a SAML service provider (SP).
For more information on Okta as a Zscaler partner, see the [Okta partner page](https://www.zscaler.com/partners/okta).
