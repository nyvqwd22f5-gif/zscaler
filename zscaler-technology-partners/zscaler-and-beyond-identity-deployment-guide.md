The Zscaler and Beyond Identity Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the Beyond Identity platform.
Beyond Identity Secure Workforce provides a passwordless authentication solution and leverages X.509 certificates without needing a certificate authority or any certificate management. It extends the chain of trust established by Transport Layer Security (TLS) to users and their devices.
You can integrate Zscaler with Beyond Identity either directly or via their existing SSO.
