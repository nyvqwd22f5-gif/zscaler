The Zscaler and Zoom Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) with Zoom Call Quality Monitoring (CQM).
ZDX for Zoom allows IT to monitor calls or meetings among two or more participants to rapidly detect poor video, audio, or sharing quality and review affected meetings and their participants, devices, regions, and offices.
The Zoom quality of service dashboard allows you to see the overall quality of voice calls and filter data by any extension. The dashboard uses the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) as the main measurement to report on voice quality. Using ZDX with Zoom, you can:
- Obtain visibility into Zoom call quality for all users.
- Isolate root causes of poor user experiences.
- Unify meeting details with performance insights.
