The Zscaler and GitLab Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) to work with the GitLab platform.
GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software.
The ZPC scans and identifies security misconfigurations in the IaC Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, and CloudFormation templates within GitLab. When you add or update the code and make a merge request, the IaC Scan action automatically triggers a scan of the IaC templates, identifies security misconfigurations, and displays the scan results within the code. This allows you to fix the configuration errors before deployment and ensure your code is secure and compliant with the security policies.
