The Zscaler and Bitglass Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features with the Bitglass platform.
Bitglass' reverse proxy technology protects and controls cloud data access from both managed and unmanaged devices. Bitglass provides data loss prevention (DLP), advanced threat protection (ATP), and sensitive data sharing detection in one simple console.
The Zscaler and Bitglass joint solution enables customers to securely adopt cloud services by enforcing security controls across any cloud app from managed and unmanaged, BYO devices:
- Web Browsing logs are sent from Zscaler to Bitglass to produce a Bitglass Cloud Visibility Report.
- Managed device and network traffic are sent through Zscaler.
- Unmanaged device traffic is redirected through Bitglass.
