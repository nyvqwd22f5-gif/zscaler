The Zscaler and VMware Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator.
VMware SD-WAN Orchestrators function as the management plane and can be hosted on different premises supporting different consumption models, from fully managed to on-premises. VMware SD-WAN Gateways help steer traffic between edges and towards the most optimal location for the cloud onramp. VMware SD-WAN Edges take care of the data plane connectivity between users and where data is located (public cloud, data center, SaaS applications).
This guide provides UI examples for configuring ZIA and VMware SD-WAN Orchestrator. All examples in this guide explain how to provision new services with Zscaler and VMware SD-WAN.
