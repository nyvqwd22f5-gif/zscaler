The Zscaler and Adaptiva Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Adaptiva Cloud and on-premises solutions.
The Adaptiva Cloud and on-premises Adaptiva solutions combine an advanced software distribution engine with an architecture that extends the boundaries of the enterprise network to the entire internet. An Adaptiva and Zscaler integration securely manages endpoints at speed and scale regardless of where they are located. Enterprises can distribute content reliably and securely to all endpoints, including those not connected to the corporate network.
