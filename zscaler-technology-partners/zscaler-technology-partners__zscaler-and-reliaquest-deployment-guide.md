The Zscaler and ReliaQuest Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the ReliaQuest GreyMatter platform.
ZIA delivers cloud-based protection for web and non-web traffic for all users and devices regardless of where they connect. Customers can improve connectivity and availability by using Zscaler to securely direct traffic without backhauling via VPNs, and without duplicating the security appliance stack at each location.
The GreyMatter integration for Zscaler uses Zscaler APIs to remediate any threats found by GreyMatter automatically.
