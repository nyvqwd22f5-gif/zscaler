The Zscaler and SecLytics Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the SecLytics Augur platform.
SecLytics Augur is a Predictive Detection and Response (PDR) platform that hardens your perimeter, provides threat visibility, and enables smart automation and orchestration.
The SecLytics integration sends Zscaler automated, accurate, and actionable attack predictions. The customized prediction information, in the form of URLs or IP addresses, is pushed to Zscaler via APIs, protecting you against malicious traffic before there is any risk.
