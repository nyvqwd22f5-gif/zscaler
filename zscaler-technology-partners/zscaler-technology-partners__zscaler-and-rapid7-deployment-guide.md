The Zscaler and Rapid7 Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) to work with the Rapid7 InsightIDR cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) platform.
Rapid7's InsightIDR is a cloud-native SIEM and XDR that uses a native endpoint agent, network sensors, collectors, and APIs to monitor your network. Lightweight software-based collection technology and integration unify, correlate, and attribute data into a single picture.
Zscaler Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) retrieves logs from the Zscaler cloud and sends them into InsightIDR.
Zscaler's UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies. Zscaler UVM offers the preconfigured Rapid7 connectors for Rapid7 InsightVM vulnerabilities, Rapid7 InsightVM assets, Rapid7 InsightCloudSec assets, and Rapid7 InsightCloudSec findings.
