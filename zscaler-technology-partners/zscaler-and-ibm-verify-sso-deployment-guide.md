The Zscaler and IBM Verify SSO Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with IBM Verify for single sign-on (SSO).
Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity through the use of credentials and other additional identity factors. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the preferred authentication method for ZIA and ZPA. This document shows how to configure IBM Security Verify as the SAML identity provider (IdP). SAML allows IBM to authenticate a user and pass the authorization credentials to ZIA as a SAML service provider (SP).
