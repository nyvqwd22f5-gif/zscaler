The Zscaler and Saviynt Connector Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud (EIC).
Saviynt’s cloud-architected identity and access governance platform helps modern enterprises scale cloud initiatives and solve security and compliance challenges. The EIC brings together Identity Governance & Administration (IGA), granular application access, cloud security, and privileged access management (PAM) to secure the entire business ecosystem.
This deployment guide explains how to integrate the EIC and the collaboration platform hosted by ZIA and ZPA to execute importing, provisioning, and de-provisioning tasks.
