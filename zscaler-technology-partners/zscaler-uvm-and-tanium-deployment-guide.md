The Zscaler and Tanium Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Client Connector and Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) features with Tanium Deploy and Autonomous Endpoint Management (AEM).
This document describes how to deploy Zscaler Client Connector to Windows devices in your environment using Tanium’s Deploy module, and integrate the Zscaler UVM solution with AEM.
Deploy is a software management module that rapidly installs, updates, and removes software across large organizations with minimal infrastructure requirements.
Tanium's AEM suite is an endpoint management provider, offering advanced, real-time visibility and control across extensive enterprise environments.
Zscaler's UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies.
Zscaler UVM offers the following preconfigured Tanium AEM connectors:
- Tanium Assets: Retrieves essential asset data, such as serial number, computer ID, operating system, IP address.
- Tanium Compliance: Retrieves a detailed list of all compliance findings on the endpoint, including ID, state, category, rule, first found date, last scan date.
- Tanium CVE: Retrieves vulnerability data, including CVE ID, score, summary, last scan date, severity.
