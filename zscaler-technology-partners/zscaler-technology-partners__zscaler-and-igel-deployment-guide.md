The Zscaler and IGEL Deployment Guide provides instructions on using clientless Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with the IGEL OS.
IGEL OS and Zscaler work together to provide a streamlined approach to empowering browser-based productivity from secure employee and contractor endpoints. The IGEL OS offers a robust platform to access Zscaler's Isolation and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) solutions. This interoperability delivers a secure, zero trust endpoint, and enables streamlined access to Software as a Service (SaaS), private apps, remote desktops, servers, or devices. This happens from the user’s browser of choice, without the need for traditional virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) or an expensive local OS.
