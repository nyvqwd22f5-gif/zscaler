The Zscaler and Splunk Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with the Splunk app.
Splunk is a leader in data analytics, security incident management, orchestration, and automation. Zscaler can stream logs into customer environments via Zscaler-supplied virtual machines that execute in a customer’s (or partner’s) hosted compute environment. These virtual machines attach to the Zscaler cloud using outbound connections, and receive encrypted and tokenized logs to stream into customer log collection and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms.
Zscaler’s integration with Splunk follows Splunk’s well-defined framework designed specifically to be installed and run in a Splunk environment.
For more information on Splunk as a Zscaler partner, see the [Splunk partner page](https://www.zscaler.com/partners/splunk).
