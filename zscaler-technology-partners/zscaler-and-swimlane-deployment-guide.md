The Zscaler and Swimlane Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Swimlane platform.
Swimlane's cloud-scale, low-code security automation improves the ease with which security teams can overcome process and data fatigue, as well as chronic staffing shortages. Swimlane unlocks the potential of automation beyond the SOC by delivering a low-code platform that serves as the system of record for the entire security organization and enables anyone within the organization to contribute their knowledge and expertise to the protection of the organization.
Zscaler works with the Swimlane platform to help secure assets monitored by the Swimlane platform.
