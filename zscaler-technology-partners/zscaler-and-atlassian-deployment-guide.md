The Zscaler and Atlassian Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) with the Atlassian platform.
The Atlassian suite of team collaboration software (such as Bitbucket, Confluence, Jira, etc.) helps teams organize, discuss, and complete shared work.
ZIA provides security for Atlassian Software as a Service (SaaS) products through access control, identity control, SaaS Security Posture Management, a SaaS API to scan the attachments for malicious content, and Data Loss Prevention (DLP). ZIA also provides complete security for clients, whether in the corporate or home office.
ZPC offers data protection, high availability, and resiliency for all imported, stored, and exported data types. ZPC leverages cloud service provider APIs to connect to your hybrid, multi-cloud environments and collect real-time configuration metadata for your cloud infrastructure, such as web servers, databases, and virtual machines. ZPC evaluates the metadata and offers visibility into your security, compliance, and risk posture.
This guide covers the following ZIA and ZPC features for Atlassian security:
- Cloud Browser Isolation
- SaaS Security Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Malware Detection
- Cloud Application Access Control
- ZPC for Jira Incident Creation
