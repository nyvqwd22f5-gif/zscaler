The Zscaler and Arctic Wolf Deployment Guide provides instructions on configuring Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to send Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) and Cloud NSS messages to Arctic Wolf sensors.
The NSS uses a virtual machine (VM) to stream traffic logs in real time from the Zscaler Nanolog to a security information and event management (SIEM) system. These logs enable real-time alerting, correlation with other device logs, and long-term local log archival.
Cloud NSS allows you to instantly stream logs from ZIA directly into a compatible cloud-based SIEM system without the need to deploy an NSS VM for Web or Firewall.
