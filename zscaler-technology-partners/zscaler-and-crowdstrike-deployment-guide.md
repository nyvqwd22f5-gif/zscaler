The Zscaler and CrowdStrike Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with the CrowdStrike platform.
ZIA and ZPA work with the CrowdStrike platform to help lightweight-agent architecture leverage artificial intelligence (AI) for better real-time protection and visibility across the enterprise, preventing attacks on endpoints and workloads on or off the network.
CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection Enterprise Platform sets a new standard with the first cloud-native security platform that delivers an endpoint breach prevention solution. It is the only endpoint breach prevention solution that unifies Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), managed threat hunting, and threat intelligence automation in a single cloud-delivered agent. CrowdStrike ZTA delivers real-time security posture assessments across all endpoints regardless of location, network, and user.
This guide explains how to integrate Zscaler and CrowdStrike deployments for the following scenarios:
- ZIA and ZPA Posture Check Integration with CrowdStrike ZTA
- ZPA Posture Check Integration with CrowdStrike
- ZIA Sandbox Integration with CrowdStrike
- Threat Intelligence Sharing: CrowdStrike Falcon and ZIA
- CrowdStrike Humio Essential Configuration (Cloud-to-Cloud)
- CrowdStrike NG-SIEM Essential Configuration (Cloud-to-Cloud)
- Extended Detection and Response
- Prevent Lateral Movement—Zscaler Deception and CrowdStrike
- Contextualizing Risk—Zscaler UVM and CrowdStrike
