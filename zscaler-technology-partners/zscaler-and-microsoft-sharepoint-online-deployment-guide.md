The Zscaler and Microsoft SharePoint Online Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features for SharePoint Security and Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) for SharePoint performance visibility.
Microsoft is an industry leader in cloud-centric environments and has demonstrated the advantages of SaaS applications for enterprises. SaaS services are popular because they enable collaboration, share resources globally, and accelerate productivity. But the downside of this access and sharing is an increase in security risk.
This guide covers the following SharePoint ZIA security and ZDX performance visibility integrations:
- SaaS Security Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- SaaS Security Malware Detection
- SSL Decryption
- Cloud Application Access Control
- ZDX for SharePoint
