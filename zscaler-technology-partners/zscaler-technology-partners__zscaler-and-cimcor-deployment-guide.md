The Zscaler and Cimcor Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with CimTrak.
The integration of Zscaler with CimTrak significantly enhances the protection of your environment. CimTrak’s real-time detections and alerts trigger automated, targeted policies in Zscaler. This enables swift action in response to critical security events, changes in a system’s hardening status, or when the system fails to meet DISA STIGs/CIS benchmarks.
CimTrak’s instant awareness of these events allows Zscaler to take immediate action, such as locking down specific environments, restricting access to infected cloud applications, isolating suspicious users, and more.
