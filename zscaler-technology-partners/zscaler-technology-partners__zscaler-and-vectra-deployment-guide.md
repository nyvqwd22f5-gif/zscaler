The Zscaler and Vectra Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with Vectra Cognito Brain.
Customers using ZIA with Vectra have two options: on-premises capture (which is an older method that has been supported for several years) and the new PCAP ingestion method (which is currently in public preview for
Vectra).
Vectra sensors and ZPA logs generated by the Log Streaming Service (LSS) track behaviors undertaken by remote workers. These logs are preferably sourced from a dedicated app connector group used only for LSS, contain data related to the activities brokered through App Connectors that are used for ZPA traffic, and (when forwarded to the Cognito Brain) form the basis of this integration. The Cognito Brain serves as an enterprise log receiver in ZPA parlance.
