The Zscaler and Darktrace Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Darktrace appliances.
The Zscaler and Darktrace integration ingests weblogs from a ZIA device to simulate connection data. Connection events created from Zscaler logs are available for core Darktrace analysis. The Zscaler and Darktrace integration ingests User Activity logs produced by ZPA, allowing connectivity patterns seen in network traffic to be matched back to remote users.
