The Zscaler and 1Password Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with 1Password-Kolide.
1Password-Kolide is a solution that focuses on enhancing endpoint security through continuous monitoring, automated compliance checks, and user engagement. You can prevent devices that have the Kolide and Zscaler integration installed from accessing any apps behind SSO unless Zscaler is installed, running, and properly configured.
Integrating Zscaler and 1Password strengthens an organization's security posture by combining robust credential management with advanced threat protection and secure access controls.
