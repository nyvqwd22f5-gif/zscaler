The Zscaler and Aruba EdgeConnect SD-Branch Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Aruba EdgeConnect SD-Branch platform.
Aruba's EdgeConnect SD-Branch architecture offers scalable enterprise-grade advanced threat protection. To secure traffic, the Aruba Branch Gateway (BGW) redirects selected traffic through the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). This enables services like advanced threat protection and data loss prevention without the need to increase the footprint in branch locations. The integration with ZIA provides a simple and scalable solution for advanced threat protection in branch networks.
