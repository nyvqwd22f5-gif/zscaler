The Zscaler and Microsoft Sentinel Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to send Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) messages to Microsoft Azure Sentinel.
Nanolog stores log messages, and can forward these to various log feeds to a security information and event management (SIEM) tool via a secure tunnel. When an NSS receives the logs from the Nanolog, it unscrambles them, applies the configured filters to exclude unwanted logs, converts the filtered logs to the configured output format so they can be parsed by an SIEM (such as Microsoft Sentinel).
