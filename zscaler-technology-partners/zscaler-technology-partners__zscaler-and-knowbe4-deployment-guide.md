The Zscaler and KnowBe4 Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with KnowBe4 SecurityCoach.
SecurityCoach enables real-time security coaching for users in response to risky security behavior. Based on the rules in the existing security software stack, you can configure a real-time coaching campaign to determine the frequency and type of SecurityTip that is sent to users at the moment risky behavior is detected.
When completed, data provided by Zscaler is available under the SecurityCoach tab of your KMSAT console. You can view this data in SecurityCoach reports and use it to create detection rules for real-time coaching campaigns. The following steps are needed for this integration:
- Generate a SecurityCoach organization and API key.
- Set up a log stream from ZIA to SecurityCoach.
