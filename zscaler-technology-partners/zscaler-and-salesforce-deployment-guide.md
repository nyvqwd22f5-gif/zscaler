The Zscaler and Salesforce Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) with the Salesforce SaaS platform.
Salesforce is an industry leader that defined cloud platform utility and the advantages that a SaaS application provides to organizations of all types. ZIA provides Salesforce SaaS security by using access control, identity control, SaaS security posture management, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and a SaaS API to scan Salesforce attachments for malicious content. The ZDX service provides user-specific experience monitoring and visibility to the Salesforce service to help organizations address any user experience concerns or challenges.
