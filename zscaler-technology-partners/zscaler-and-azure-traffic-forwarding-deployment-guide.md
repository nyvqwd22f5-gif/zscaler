The Zscaler and Azure Traffic Forwarding Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) traffic forwarding with Microsoft Azure Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD).
You can integrate Azure and Zscaler by forwarding Internet traffic from Azure to ZIA using the Zscaler Client Connector on a dedicated private WVD Instance, a browser PAC file, or over an IPSec tunnel. You can connect customer traffic destined for internal private resources seamlessly and securely over ZPA by placing a ZPA application connector inside the Azure environment.
This deployment guide covers all the available traffic forwarding methods. IPSec tunnels are created using the Azure Virtual Network Gateway, and the Zscaler Client Connector is deployed on a WVD private instance to both ZIA and ZPA.
