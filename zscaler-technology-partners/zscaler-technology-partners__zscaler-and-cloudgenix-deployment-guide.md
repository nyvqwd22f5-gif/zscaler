The Zscaler and CloudGenix Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the CloudGenix SD-WAN platform.
The integration of CloudGenix SD-WAN and ZIA allows customers to have a lightweight remote office hardware footprint while still being able to provide a full suite of application-specific security policies. The ZIA integration with CloudBlade provides the automatic creation, management, and maintenance of third-party IPsec VPN tunnels by entering tags on the appropriate CloudGenix objects.
