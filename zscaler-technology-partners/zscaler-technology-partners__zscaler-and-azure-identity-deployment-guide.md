The Zscaler and Azure Identity Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Identity.
Azure AD is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service that is an integral part of the Azure solution. It provides authentication, conditional access, device management, domain services, identity governance, identity protection, and privileged identity management. Identity, authentication, and provisioning (IAP) is an inherent part of the Zscaler solution and provides granular user visibility, logging, and security down to the individual user level.
