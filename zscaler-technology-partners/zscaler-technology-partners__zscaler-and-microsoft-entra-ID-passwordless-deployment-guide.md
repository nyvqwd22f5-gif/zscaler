The Zscaler and Microsoft Entra ID Passwordless Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Microsoft Entra ID Passwordless sign-on.
Going passwordless refers to removing your password and using a passwordless method to sign in instead. Passwordless solutions such as Windows Hello, the Microsoft Authenticator app, SMS or Email codes, and physical security keys provide a more secure and convenient sign-in method.
This deployment guide was written to help organizations implement a passwordless authentication model for Zscaler Client Connector authentication for two key use cases:
- Windows Hello for Business for dedicated Windows 10/11 computers.
- Microsoft Authenticator app for shared devices such as tablets and mobile phones, non-windows devices, or unmanaged Windows 10/11 computers.
This deployment guide takes you through a sample deployment, using a specific use case (Microsoft Entra ID Hybrid Joined Devices with a Cloud Kerberos Trust Group Policy).
