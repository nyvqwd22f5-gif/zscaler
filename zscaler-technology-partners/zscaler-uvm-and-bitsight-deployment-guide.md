The Zscaler UVM and Bitsight Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) features with the Bitsight Security Ratings product.
Bitsight Security Ratings is a cyber risk quantification and monitoring platform designed to provide continuous, data-driven visibility into an organization’s external security posture.

- Bitsight Findings: Retrieves information about findings, which are security-related events or configurations on an asset, such as a vulnerability, detection of a botnet, or a port detected to be open.
- Bitsight Observations: Retrieve detailed information (observations) about the risk category data of companies in your portfolio.
