The Zscaler and Slack Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) with the Slack platform.
ZIA provides Slack SaaS security by using access control, identity control, data loss protection (DLP), and the SaaS API to scan the Slack attachments for malicious content. The ZDX service monitors the user-specific experience and provides visibility for the Slack service to help organizations address any user-experience concerns or challenges. Both ZIA SaaS security and ZDX SaaS monitoring operate as separate stand-alone services and are not dependent on one or the other. This guide covers the following ZIA and ZDX features:
- SaaS Identity Proxy
- Tenant Restrictions
- SaaS Security Data Loss Protection
- SaaS Security Malware Detection
- Cloud Application Access Control
- ZDX for Slack
