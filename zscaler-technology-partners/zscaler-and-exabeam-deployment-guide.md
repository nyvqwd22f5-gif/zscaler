The Zscaler and Exabeam Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Exabeam Security Management Platform.
Using the Exabeam Security Management Platform, analysts can collect log data, use behavioral analytics to detect attacks, and automate incident responses—both on-premises and in the cloud. Organizations can take advantage of its big data architecture, advanced analytics, and automation capabilities.
Zscaler streams logs to the Exabeam platform by deploying Zscaler's Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) virtual machines (VMs) or using Zscaler’s Cloud NSS. The NSS VMs pull logs from the Zscaler Nanolog and streams them to Exabeam over syslog or TCP. Cloud NSS pushes logs directly from Zscaler over HTTPS.
