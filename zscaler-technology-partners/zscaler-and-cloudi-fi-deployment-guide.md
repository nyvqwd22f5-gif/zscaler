The Zscaler and Cloudi-Fi Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Cloudi-Fi platform.
Cloudi-Fi is a 100% cloud-based SaaS solution that extends the authentication capability of Zscaler to all users and devices, including guests, BYOD, and IoT.
Using Cloudi-Fi, organizations can define specific security policies per user profile and IoT category based on user profiling and identification and IoT identification and classification.
The integration of Cloud-Fi and Zscaler is particularly suited to help SD-WAN architectures ensure high levels of local access breakout security.
