The Zscaler and Microsoft Copilot Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features with Microsoft Copilot.
Microsoft Copilot enhances productivity by surfacing relevant information from across Microsoft environments. However, this capability also presents security challenges, as Copilot can retrieve and expose data stored in OneDrive, SharePoint, and other Microsoft 365 repositories. This poses a significant risk of unintended data exposure, both internally and externally.
Zscaler and ZIA address these challenges with a robust data protection approach that includes both API-based and inline controls. These solutions help organizations secure sensitive information, ensuring that Copilot does not expose critical data beyond intended access boundaries.
