The Zscaler and Proofpoint Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Proofpoint Cloud platform.
The Proofpoint Cloud service is designed to address the data security, compliance, and information governance needs of enterprises by reducing risks while using cloud-based file sharing, collaboration, and social media platforms.
The integration enables connectivity between your workplace environment and the Proofpoint Cloud service by configuring ZIA to forward traffic to the Proofpoint public ICAP server. After configuration, Proofpoint initiates the onboarding process and helps protect your environment against data loss, various threats, data risks, malicious outsider and insider threats, and more.
