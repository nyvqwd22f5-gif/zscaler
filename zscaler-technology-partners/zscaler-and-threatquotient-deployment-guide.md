The Zscaler and ThreatQuotient Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the ThreatQuotient ThreatQ platform.
ZIA maintains a global database of malicious IPs, Domains, or URLs (i.e., IoCs) and blocks these threats inline in all ZIA customer tenants if pertinent security engines are enabled by ZIA admins. ZIA also maintains per-tenant custom URL lists. You can bring in your own custom threat feeds and populate these URL lists. You can then reference these custom URL lists in ZIA URL policies for granularly controlling end-user access within that ZIA tenant.
ThreatQ expands your defenses with real-time access to global IoCs delivered by ThreatQ. An existing ThreatQ intelligence and ZIA customer can set up this integration to continually push high value threats from the ThreatQ Platform into their ZIA tenant.
This document describes how a ThreatQ admin can export FQDNs and URLs from a Threat Collection to Zscaler’s URL blacklist via the Zscaler Blacklist Export integration.
