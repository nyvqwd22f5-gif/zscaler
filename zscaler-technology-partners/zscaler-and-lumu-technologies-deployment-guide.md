The Zscaler and Lumu Technologies Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Lumu platform.
Lumu helps enterprise security teams find and isolate threats using its closed-loop, self-learning solution. Lumu accelerates compromise detection, provides real-time visibility, and shortens the breach detection gap from months to minutes.
Lumu and Zscaler, together, actively detect and block threats, securing the entire user base before attacks can be fully carried out. Metadata is collected through Zscaler and fed into Lumu’s Illumination Process. Incident data is analyzed for malicious association. If an attack is discovered, Lumu measures the compromise level, does a complete analysis of the Indicators of Compromise (IoC), and feeds the incident details to Zscaler for automatic blocking of any connections with this IoC.
Benefits:
- Expanded network threat detection.
- Continuous, real-time monitoring of the entire network.
- Rich incident context with details surrounding the attack type and asset level visibility to identify the impact.
- Instant attack response, closing the attacker’s window of opportunity.
