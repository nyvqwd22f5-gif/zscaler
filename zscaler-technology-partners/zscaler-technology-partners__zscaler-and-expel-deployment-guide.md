The Zscaler and Expel Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with the Expel Managed Detection and Response platform.
Expel Managed Detection and Response (Expel MDR) is an MDR provider that delivers rapid detection and response, and helps you build cyber resilience. Expel MDR quickly detects risks across your tech (endpoint, cloud, Kubernetes, SaaS, network, SIEM, email, identity and more) and collaborates with your team to verify the threat, take critical remediation actions, and provide a detailed report of what happened, where, when, and why in real-time.
You must configure Zscaler to send logs via the Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) and Cloud NSS to an Expel-approved SIEM such as Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, or Sumo Logic. Expel reads these logs from the connected SIEM.
