The Zscaler and Sumo Logic Deployment Guide explains how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to send Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) messages to Sumo Logic software.
The Sumo Logic App for ZIA collects logs via Cloud NSS to populate pre-configured searches and dashboards. This provides the data needed to visualize and provide insight into threats, DNS, web traffic behaviors, security, user browsing activities, and risk.
