The Zscaler UVM and Wiz Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) with the Wiz platform.
The Zscaler UVM solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies.
Zscaler UVM offers the following preconfigured Wiz connectors:
- Wiz Vulnerability Findings: Retrieves details on detected vulnerabilities, such as affected software, version, remediation recommendations, each tied to a specific resource.
- Wiz Issues: Retrieves details on active security threats (e.g., vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or exposed secrets) including severity, affected resources, and remediation recommendations for each identified threat.
- Wiz Configuration Findings: Retrieves details on configurations by identifying misconfigurations, compliance status, and potential vulnerabilities across various cloud resources.
