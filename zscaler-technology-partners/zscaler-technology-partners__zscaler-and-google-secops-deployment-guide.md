The Zscaler and Google SecOps Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with Google SecOps.
Google Security Operations (formerly known as Google Chronicle) is a cloud service, built as a specialized layer on top of Google infrastructure, designed for enterprises to privately retain, analyze, and search the large amounts of security and network telemetry they generated.
You can bring ZIA logs into Google SecOps using a webhook. This document also lists currently supported Zscaler log types.
