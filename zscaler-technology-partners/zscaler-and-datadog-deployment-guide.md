The Zscaler and Datadog Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Datadog platform.
The Datadog platform is a monitoring and analytics tool for information technology (IT) and DevOps teams that is used to determine performance metrics and event monitoring for infrastructure and cloud services. The software monitors services such as servers, databases, and tools.
Datadog readily ingests ZIA telemetry and has an app that visualizes this data in various dashboards.
