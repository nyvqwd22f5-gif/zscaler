The Zscaler and IBM QRadar Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the IBM Security QRadar Suite.
IBM Security QRadar Suite is a modernized threat detection and response solution designed to unify the security analyst experience and accelerate their speed across the full incident lifecycle.
Zscaler’s Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) uses a virtual machine (VM) to stream traffic logs from ZIA and ZPA to QRadar, providing real-time alerting, correlation with the logs of your other devices, and long-term local log archival.
If you subscribe to Cloud NSS, you can enable direct cloud-to-cloud log streaming. Instead of deploying an on-premises NSS VM, you can configure an HTTPS API feed to stream traffic logs from ZIA and ZPA into an HTTPS API-based log collector on your cloud-based QRadar system.
