The Zscaler and AlgoSec Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with AlgoSec Security Management Suite (ASMS).
The ASMS is an automation solution for network security policy management that provides end-to-end visibility of the network security infrastructure, business applications, and their connectivity flow across cloud, SDN, and on-premises enterprise networks.
ZIA Firewall integrates with AlgoSec Firewall Analyzer (AFA) to provide Zero Trust security benefits. This document describes how to set up the integration, which includes:
- Creating a ZIA Admin with a limited role within Zscaler with which ASMS communicates.
- Adding the ZIA service to ASMS.
