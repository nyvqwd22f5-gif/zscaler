The Zscaler and Google ChromeOS Flex Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Google ChromeOS Flex.
Google ChromeOS Flex is a cloud-first, fast, and secure operating system that allows you to refresh your existing PCs and Macs by installing ChromeOS on them. It's a free, lightweight alternative to traditional operating systems like Windows or macOS, designed for users who primarily rely on web-based applications and services.
Zscaler supports ChromeOS Flex for managed devices through Google’s ChromeOS device management, which is accessible through the Google Admin console. Following the steps outlined in this deployment guide allows organizations to deploy and run Zscaler Client Connector for ChromeOS Flex.
