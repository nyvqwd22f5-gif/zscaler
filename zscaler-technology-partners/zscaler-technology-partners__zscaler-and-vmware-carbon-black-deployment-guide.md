The Zscaler and VMware Carbon Black Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the Carbon Black platform.
Carbon Black security products are a cloud-native security platform that delivers an endpoint breach prevention solution that unifies NGAV, EDR, managed threat hunting, and threat intelligence automation in a single cloud-delivered agent. ZIA is a secure internet and web gateway delivered from the cloud and provides a fully integrated security stack that includes SSL inspection, web gateway, firewall, bandwidth control, DLP and more. ZPA is a cloud service that uses a distributed architecture to provide fast and secure access to private applications running on-premises or in the public cloud.
The integration of the two platforms provides end-to-end visibility and protection from endpoint to applications in the cloud. The resulting integrated solution can enable cross-platform workflows that reduce dwell time and mean-time-to-remediate (MTTR).
