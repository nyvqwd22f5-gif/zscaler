The Zscaler UVM and Qualys Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler UVM to work with the Qualys Vulnerability Management, Detection, and Response platform.
Qualys Vulnerability Management, Detection, and Response (VMDR) is a comprehensive, cloud-based solution designed to streamline the entire vulnerability management lifecycle, from discovery to remediation.
Zscaler's Data Fabric and Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) solution ingests, normalizes, and unifies data across enterprise security and business systems to deliver actionable insights, analytics, and operational efficiencies.
This guide outlines how to start ingesting data from these sources, while also (optionally) combining Qualys Vulnerabilities data with Zscaler Client Connector device information to provide a more contextualized and personalized risk assessment for your organization.
