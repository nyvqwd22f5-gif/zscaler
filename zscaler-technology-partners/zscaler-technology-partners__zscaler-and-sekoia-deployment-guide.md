The Zscaler and Sekoia Deployment Guide explains how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to send Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) messages to Sekoia XDR.
Sekoia XDR leverages Cyber Threat Intelligence to combine anticipation with automated incident response. You can integrate and analyze the events and alerts produced by your applications, endpoints, cloud, and SaaS perimeters in real time, and protect your assets from potential cyber threats.
This document describes how to integrate Sekoia XDR with ZIA. ZIA sends logs out via two different mechanisms: NSS and Cloud NSS.
