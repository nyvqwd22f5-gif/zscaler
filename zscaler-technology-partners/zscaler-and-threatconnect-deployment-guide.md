The Zscaler and ThreatConnect Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the ThreatConnect platform.
ThreatConnect provides relevant and actionable insights from intelligence sources within the platform. Based on that intelligence, users can take action by providing insights to the necessary users and technologies in their security environment.
These notifications are sent to ZIA and added to a URL category in ZIA's blocklist. If the category does not already exist, a new category is created under the user-defined category section.
Two apps comprise the ThreatConnect Platform and Zscaler integration. The first is the Zscaler Job App which selects specific URL and host indicators and adds them to a Zscaler blocklist. The second is the Zscaler Playbook App which performs several actions with the Zscaler platform, such as managing blocklists, retrieving details on DLP Dictionaries, submitting files to the Zscaler sandbox, and much more.
