The Zscaler and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.
Zscaler and SAP Enterprise Cloud Services (ECS) have created an ECS-managed service that deploys ZPA App Connectors inside a customer's ECS-managed service environment on the AWS, Azure, or GCP hyperscalers.
The ZPA App Connectors permit a customer to establish zero trust connectivity from their desktop-based client devices to the SAP applications running in the ECS environment.
