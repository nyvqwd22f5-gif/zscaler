The Zscaler and Torq Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features with the Torq platorm.
This guide helps users build Zscaler integrations in Torq to enhance threat detection and response efficiency.
Torq enables quick and easy integration with ZIA, so you can automate anything and everything within moments. Use ZIA to trigger workflows in Torq, and use ZIA steps in your Torq workflows. Torq’s public ZIA steps include:
-
Create session
-
List Denylisted URLs
-
Add URLs to Denylist
-
Create URL Filtering Policy Rule
- +30 more
If you don’t see a step you need, you can create your own in various ways, such as using the Send an HTTP Request step or Torq’s Step Builder, and share it across your organization
