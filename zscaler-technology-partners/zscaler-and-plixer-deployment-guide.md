The Zscaler and Plixer Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with the Plixer platform.
Zscaler Cloud Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) is an optional service that uses HTTP and HTTPS to send logs. With Cloud NSS, there is no need to deploy a VM.
When a ZIA log ingestion is configured and enabled, Plixer Scrutinizer can run both preconfigured and custom reports against the collected ZIA log data.
When a ZPA log ingestion is configured and enabled, Plixer Scrutinizer can run both preconfigured and custom reports against the collected ZPA log data.
