The Zscaler and Azure DevOps Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) with the Azure DevOps platform.
Microsoft Azure DevOps provides an integrated set of services and tools to manage your software projects, from planning and development through testing and deployment.
ZPC's Zscaler IaC Scan security feature enables you to apply security controls on your IaC infrastructure before deployment. The IaC Scan tool scans the IaC templates for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities that are a potential risk for attacks.
This deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the Zscaler IaC Scan app with Azure Repos. The integration enables the IaC Scan app to scan and monitor your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for misconfigurations.
