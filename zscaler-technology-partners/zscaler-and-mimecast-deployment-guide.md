The Zscaler and Mimecast Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Mimecast Threat Sharing feature.
ZIA maintains a global database of malicious IPs, Domains, or URLs (i.e., IoCs), and blocks these threats inline in all ZIA customer tenants if pertinent security engines are enabled by ZIA admins. ZIA also maintains per-tenant custom URL lists. You can bring in your own custom threat feeds and populate these URL lists. You can then reference these custom URL lists in ZIA URL policies for granularly controlling end user access within that ZIA tenant.
Mimecast expands your defenses with real-time access to global IoCs delivered by Mimecast Threat Sharing. An existing Mimecast and ZIA customer can configure this integration to continually push high-value threats from Mimecast into a ZIA tenant.
This deployment guide describes how to configure the Zscaler and Mimecast integration. After it is configured, each integration instance creates an associated URL category in Zscaler. This is used as the destination of any malicious domains sourced from Mimecast by this specific integration configuration instance.
