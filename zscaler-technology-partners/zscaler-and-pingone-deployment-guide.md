The Zscaler and Ping Identity Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the Ping One platform.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the preferred method for authentication for both ZIA and ZPA, and Ping Identity is configured as the SAML identity provider (IdP). SAML is an open protocol standard that allows Ping Identity to authenticate a user and pass the authorization credentials to Zscaler services as a SAML service provider (SP). Provisioning as it relates to authentication is the automation of provisioning and de-provisioning of users and security groups to Zscaler services.
