The Zscaler and HashiCorp Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with the HashiCorp Terraform platform.
Terraform is an open source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that creates, manages, and updates infrastructure across service providers. Terraform manages physical machines, virtual machines, load balancers, firewalls, and many other resources. Terraform maintains state information as it creates, updates, and deletes your resources.
This workflow gives DevOps teams guidelines on use cases for including ZPA as part of their DevSecOps security and compliance workflows. ZPA keeps Zero Trust policies up-to-date since only authorized users can apply configurations to production environments after careful scanning, verification, and approval.
Part of this configuration requires a ServiceNow template.
