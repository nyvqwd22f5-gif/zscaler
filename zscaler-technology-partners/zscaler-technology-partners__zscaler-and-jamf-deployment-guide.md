The Zscaler and Jamf Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Client Connector features with Jamf Trust.
Jamf Trust is a user-facing app that assists in providing security and compliance solutions for organizations while ensuring a simple and intuitive interface for users. It allows admins to protect devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops from various security risks while simultaneously ensuring user data remains private.
Zscaler Client Connector captures and uses Device Posture Profile criteria in policy decisions for both Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to determine whether access should be allowed or not, based on the outcome of the evaluation.
This guide explains how Zscaler Client Connector uses the device’s risk score as determined by the Jamf Trust app.
