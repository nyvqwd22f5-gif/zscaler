The Zscaler and Extreme Networks Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with the Extreme Networks ExtremeCloud SD-WAN platform.
This guide explains how to configure ZIA and ExtremeCloud SD-WAN (a.k.a. XC SD-WAN) so that traffic from a branch site equipped with an SD-WAN appliance to the internet is secure. This is done by redirecting traffic to ZIA Public Service Edges via IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnels.
