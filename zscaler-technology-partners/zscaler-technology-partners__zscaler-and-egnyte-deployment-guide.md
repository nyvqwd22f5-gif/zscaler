The Zscaler and Okta Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Egnyte Secure and Govern platform.
Egnyte Secure and Govern provides safeguards to prevent data in the Egnyte Cloude from unauthorized access and accidental sharing. After the data is downloaded to endpoints (e.g., user laptops and mobile devices), Egnyte detects unusual activity and potential data exfiltration attempts. However, Egnyte cannot prevent end users from copying files to external storage or uploading files to non-authorized clouds.
Egnyte and Zscaler have partnered to provide customers with in-line, preventive endpoint controls.
