The Zscaler and Hunters Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to configure Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with the Hunters SOC Platform.
Hunters Security Operations Center (SOC) Platform empowers security teams to automatically identify and respond to incidents that matter, helping teams mitigate real threats faster and more reliably than SIEM.
You must configure Zscaler to send logs via the Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) to a Hunter Data Collector. This guide provides the necessary actions and steps to configure log forwarding on Zscaler NSS.
