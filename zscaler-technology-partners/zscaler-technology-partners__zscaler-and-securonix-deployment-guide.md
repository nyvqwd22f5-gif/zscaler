The Zscaler and Securonix Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler features with the Securonix SNYPR application.
A connector is used to establish communication between the SNYPR application and a data source. Following a successful deployment, the connector makes data from a data source available to query and view in the SNYPR application. The instructions in this deployment guide describe how to deploy Zscaler security log data in the SNYPR application.
