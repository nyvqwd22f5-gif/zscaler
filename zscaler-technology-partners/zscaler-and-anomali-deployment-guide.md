The Zscaler and Anomali Deployment Guide provides instructions on how to integrate Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) features with Anomali ThreatStream.
The integration of Zscaler and Anomali allows ThreatStream to forward IP addresses, domains, and URLs that should be blocked to ZIA. ZIA can block a maximum of 25,000 observables per day that are forwarded based on a defined search query.
