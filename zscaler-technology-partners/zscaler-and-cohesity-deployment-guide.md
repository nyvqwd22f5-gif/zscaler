The Zscaler and Cohesity Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to work with the Cohesity Data Cloud.
The two major solution components of the Cohesity and Zscaler integration are Cohesity Data Cloud and Zscaler Data Loss Prevention (DLP). Cohesity Data Cloud does backup, recovery, and sensitive data discovery. The sensitive data is then sent to the Zscaler DLP solution and fingerprinted and indexed. The Zscaler Client Connector blocks or allows the transmission of the data as per the user-configured policy.
