The Zscaler and Cybereason Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) with Cybereason XDR.
Cybereason XDR predicts, understands, and ends cyber attacks by fusing varied telemetry sources into visual attack stories.
The combination of Zscaler and Cybereason provides a multi-layer block-and-detect approach against drive-by-compromise, command-and-control, unknown network connections, account takeover, and ransomware.
- Telemetry and critical events from ZIA are streamed to Cybereason XDR, where suspicious events across your environment are correlated into Malicious Operations (MalOps), a visual timeline of any high-severity incident.
- When you send data from your ZPA instance to Cybereason XDR, you export logs with a dedicated app connector and Log Streaming Service (LSS).
