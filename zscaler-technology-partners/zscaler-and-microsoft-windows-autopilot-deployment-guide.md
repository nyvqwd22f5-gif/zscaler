The Zscaler and Microsoft Windows Autopilot Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) and Microsoft Windows Autopilot.
Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new devices, getting them ready for productive use. Windows Autopilot offers two approaches for onboarding devices: Windows Autopilot with Azure AD Join and Windows Autopilot with Hybrid Azure AD Join. This guide covers the second approach, where Windows Autopilot with Hybrid Azure AD leverages ZPA for connectivity to on-premises AD during the enrollment process.
