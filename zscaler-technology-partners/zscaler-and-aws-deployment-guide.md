The Zscaler and AWS Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), Zscaler Deception, Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM), and other Zscaler products with Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Snowball, S3, CloudWatch, Amazon Q Gen AI, GuardDuty, etc.
AWS is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of organizations use AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.
This guide helps AWS users to enable and deploy ZIA, ZPA, Deception, Zscaler UVM, and other Zscaler products for AWS tenants. After configuring AWS to work with Zscaler, AWS traffic passes through Zscaler’s cloud and Zscaler enforces security policies on AWS traffic.
