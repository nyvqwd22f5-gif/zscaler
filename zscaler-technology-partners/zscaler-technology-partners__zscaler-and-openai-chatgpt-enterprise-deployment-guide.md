The Zscaler and OpenAI ChatGPT Enterprise Deployment Guide provides instructions on using Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) features with the OpenAI ChatGPT Enterprise platform.
ZIA provides security and control over how an organization's employees use ChatGPT and other Gen AI tools. Rather than simply blocking these tools, ZIA enables companies to safely use AI for productivity by offering granular visibility, data protection, and policy enforcement.
Zscaler integrates with the ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API to alert on sensitive data or malware. This gives security teams deep visibility into how corporate data is used within the enterprise version of ChatGPT.
The following are key functions of ZIA with inline Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Cloud Application Control, and AI reporting:
- Provides full visibility into the queries and prompts users submit to ChatGPT by inspecting encrypted traffic via SSL and TLS inspection.
- Lets you create Cloud Application Control rules for how your users access specific cloud applications such as ChatGPT. For example, you can define a rule for blocking image uploads to ChatGPT, but allowing other access.
- Uses inline DLP for Gen AI public sites such as ChatGPT.
