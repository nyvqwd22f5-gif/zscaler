The Zscaler and Arista Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) to work with the Arista NDR platform.
Arista’s Zero Trust networking principles, based on NIST 800-207, help customers address this challenge with three cornerstones: visibility, continuous diagnostics, and enforcement. The Arista NDR platform delivers continuous diagnostics for the entire enterprise threat landscape, processes countless points of data, senses abnormalities or threats, and reacts if necessary.
The Arista NDR and Zscaler integration provides improved visibility and contextual information on potential security threats present on your network, enabling prompt response actions against detected threats. This integration enriches and associates IOC information, such as domains, identified in the network by Arista NDR with the global classification data from Zscaler.
