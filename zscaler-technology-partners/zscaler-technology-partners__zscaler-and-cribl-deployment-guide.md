The Zscaler and Cribl Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) with the Cribl product portfolio.
The current version of this document describes how to integrate Cribl with ZIA using Cloud Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS). ZIA sends logs via two different mechanisms: NSS and Cloud NSS. NSS uses Syslog over TCP, which requires the deployment of a Zscaler NSS Virtual Machine.
Cloud NSS is an optional service managed by Zscaler and uses HTTP and HTTPS to send logs. With Cloud NSS, there is no need to deploy a VM.
