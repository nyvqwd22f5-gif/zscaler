The Zscaler and Devo Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) with the Devo platform.
The Devo platform is a cloud-native SaaS SIEM solution that delivers full visibility of your data and risk posture. With real-time security analytics and automation, your SOC team is positioned to accelerate threat detection, investigation, and response, which reduces your organization’s cybersecurity risk.
ZIA sends logs via Cloud Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS). NSS uses syslog over TCP, which requires the deployment of a Zscaler NSS Virtual Machine.
This document describes how to integrate Devo with ZIA Cloud NSS.
