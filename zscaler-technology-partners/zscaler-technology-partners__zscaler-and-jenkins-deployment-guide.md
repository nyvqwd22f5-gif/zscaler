The Zscaler and Jenkins Deployment Guide provides instructions on integrating Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) with the Jenkins platform.
Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.
The ZPC IaC Scan app scans and identifies security misconfigurations in the IaC Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, and CloudFormation templates for both freestyle and pipeline jobs in Jenkins. The IaC Scan plugin automatically triggers a scan of the IaC templates, identifies configuration errors and policy violations, and displays the scan results within the code.
