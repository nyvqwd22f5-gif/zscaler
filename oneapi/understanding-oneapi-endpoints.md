Zscaler OneAPI endpoints are a collection of API endpoints from different Zscaler services, including Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), Zscaler Client Connector, Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector, and ZIdentity. For detailed information on all available API calls, endpoints, and parameters, see the following API Reference Guides:
- [ZIA API](/zia/zia-api/api-developer-reference-guide/reference-guide)
- [ZPA API](/zpa/zpa-api/api-developer-reference-guide/reference-guide)
- [Zscaler Client Connector API](/client-connector/zscaler-client-connector-api/api-developer-reference-guide/reference-guide)
- [Cloud & Branch Connector API](/cloud-branch-connector/zscaler-cloud-branch-connector-api/api-developer-reference-guide/reference-guide)
- [ZDX API](/zdx/zdx-api/api-developer-reference-guide/reference-guide)
- [ZIdentity](/zidentity/api-clients)
The Try In Postman and Log In to Try Request functionality within the API Reference Guides only support legacy API endpoints. In the API Reference, the downloadable Postman collection file for legacy API endpoints is not applicable to the unified OneAPI endpoints that are accessible via OneAPI.

To download the Postman collection file for the unified OneAPI endpoints, see [Configuring the Postman REST API Client](/oneapi/configuring-postman-rest-api-client).
In addition, the option to send requests to legacy API endpoints is also not applicable to the unified endpoints that are accessible via OneAPI.

Each collection of API endpoints included in OneAPI is rate limited. For a summary of the rate limits used by OneAPI, see [Understanding Rate Limiting](/oneapi/understanding-rate-limiting).
In addition, Zscaler provides API endpoints to enable customers and partners to deploy the required infrastructure and integrate the Zscaler service with their environment.
