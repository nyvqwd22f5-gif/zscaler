Static application datasets allow you to configure the front ends of web applications that are deployed using [Threat Intelligence (TI) decoys](/deception/about-threat-intelligence-decoys) and [network decoys via web services](/deception/configuring-services-network-decoy#configuring-web-service). These datasets consist of static HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. that can be used as an interface to engage adversaries submitting credentials or performing text-based web application attacks.
Static application datasets provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure the front ends that mimic legitimate web applications to lure attackers.
- Deploy network decoys of TI decoys with static web applications.
- Creating responsive web application decoys by associating them with dynamic applications or high-interaction applications.
