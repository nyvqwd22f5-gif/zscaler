You can edit or delete a subnet that you have configured in the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal.
Zscaler Deception uses Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) or Threat Intelligence (TI) subnets to deploy decoys in a dedicated Deception cloud. You cannot edit or delete these subnets. Contact Zscaler Support to manage them.
