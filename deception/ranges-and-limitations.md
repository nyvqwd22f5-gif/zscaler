This article lists the ranges and limitations for Zscaler Deception features. All values are per organization unless noted otherwise.
- If you need to increase maximum limits or upgrade the plan from Deception Standard to Deception Advanced, contact your Zscaler Account team or send a request to Zscaler Support.
- If you switch plans, then you can use only the features that are available in the active plan. Any additional features that are not a part of the active plan are disabled.
- If you subscribed to a Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) or Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) edition that includes a Deception Standard or Deception Advanced plan, you must have a minimum of 1,000 users in your subscription to be eligible to claim your Deception entitlement.
Decoy Connectors
The total number of [Decoy Connectors](/deception/about-decoy-connectors) is equal to the number of decoys included in your Deception license. For example, if your license has 50 decoys, you get 50 Decoy Connectors. System limitations are applicable.
