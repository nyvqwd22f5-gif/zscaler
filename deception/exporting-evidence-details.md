When an attacker interacts with a decoy, Zscaler Deception generates files that contain evidence of an attack. The Evidence page lists all of the generated evidence details including timestamp, Decoy Connector ID, type, and metadata. You can export this list of evidence details into a JSON or CSV file.
To export an evidence file:
- Open the [extended details](/deception/viewing-extended-details) page.
- Click the **Evidence **tab.
-
Click the **Export **drop-down menu and select an option: **Evidence as JSON** or **Evidence as CSV**.
The file is downloaded to your system.
