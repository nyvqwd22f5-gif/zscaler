You can integrate Zscaler Deception with various third-party data enrichment solutions to add relevant contextual information to the security events that are generated in the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal.
Enrichment integration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Add context for decoy activities and obtain meaningful insights into the security event logs generated in the Deception Admin Portal. For example, events can be enriched with contextual information from geolocation tools, third-party threat intelligence databases, sandbox analysis reports, etc.
- Reduce false positives, which allows you to manage security threats efficiently.
