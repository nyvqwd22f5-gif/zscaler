Zscaler Deception is a simple, faster, and more effective targeted threat detection solution built on the Zscaler Zero Trust architecture. Deception uses advanced lures and decoys to detect and disrupt sophisticated threats that consistently bypass traditional defenses, such as advanced persistent threats (APT), exploits, reconnaissance, lateral movement, active directory, supply chain, human-operated ransomware, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), and industrial control system (ICS) attacks.
As an integral part of the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, Deception integrates with Zero Trust, tracking the full attack sequence and initiating automated response actions across the Zscaler platform. To learn more, see [Zscaler Deception Overview](https://www.zscaler.com/products/deception-technology).
Why Deception?
Attackers are becoming exceptional at exploiting organizations’ growing attack surfaces. Advanced attacks bypass existing defenses. Detecting and containing them is challenging because:
- Advanced attacks are stealthy and 91% of attacks do not generate a security alert.
- Advanced attacks are human-operated and 68% of attacks do not use malware.
- Security teams have too many events to investigate because 45% of alerts are false positives.
Deception uses active defense techniques to make your network a hostile environment for attackers. It blankets your environment with decoys for all your IT artifacts. Decoys make your environment unpredictable and disrupt attackers’ playbooks. Decoys lure attackers and detect advanced attacks without operational overhead or false positives. Deception is a robust addition to your organization's threat detection and Zero Trust strategy. It’s the easiest way to add a powerful layer of high-fidelity threat detection to your entire enterprise.
Key Features and Benefits
Deception's key features and benefits include:
- Ease of deployment: Integration with the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange allows for seamless deployment. Deception is cloud-delivered and scalable, and requires minimal on-premises computing. It does not require additional hardware upgrades.
- Comprehensive coverage: Provides threat detection for your perimeter, applications, endpoints, active directories, cloud, and operational technology (OT) or internet of things (IoT) environments.
- Extensive built-in decoys: Easy to customize and manage decoys that engage savvy adversaries.
- Disrupt advanced threats: Detects and stops attackers across your security infrastructure, including low-visibility paths like DC-to-DC and internal-traffic-to-DC.
- Low false positives: There is no legitimate business traffic to decoys, so any interaction with them is an immediate high-confidence signal of an ongoing breach, alerting your security team to threats like ransomware, supply chain attacks, and APTs.
- Business risk awareness: Aligns security controls tightly to areas with current business risks.
- Orchestrated response: Orchestrates complex scenarios with high-fidelity alerts. Takes precise action to shut down active attacks, driven by high-confidence alerts.
- Active defense with the MITRE ATT&CK framework: Delivers 99% of the capabilities covered in MITRE Engage.
How does Deception Work?
Deception’s workflow is categorized as follows:
Administration
The Administration's key components include:
- Licenses: Deception issues a license to you when you subscribe.
- User Roles: Deception allows you to create users with the following roles at the license and account level:
- Administrator: Administrators can configure Decoy Connector (virtual machines), deploy decoys, view and analyze events, and orchestrate actions.
- Analyst: Analysts can investigate events, block the attackers, and export logs.
- Responder: Responders can analyze events and orchestrate actions.
-
Super admin: Super admins can view and manage all features and configurations of Deception, such as configuring user roles, APIs, decoys, audit logs, etc.
You can create a custom role with specific read and write permissions based on the requirements.
Configure Network Components
To place decoys on your network, Deception allows you to configure Decoy Connectors and connect them to the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal. You can configure virtual LANs (VLANs) in your environment to deploy network decoys. If you have deployed Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) for Zero Trust Network Access, you can integrate Deception with ZPA to deploy Zero Trust Network decoys without installing any additional network components or making any changes to your network configurations.
Configure and Deploy Decoys
Deception allows you to configure and deploy decoys to disrupt active attacks, create fake attack paths, and gain high-fidelity threat intelligence. Deception provides extensive built-in decoys across the kill chain that mimic production assets. You can configure and deploy [network decoys](/deception/about-network-decoys), [Threat Intelligence (TI) decoys](/deception/about-threat-intelligence-decoys), [Active Directory (AD) decoys](/deception/about-active-directory-decoys), [endpoint decoys](/deception/about-landmine-decoys), and [cloud decoys](/deception/understanding-cloud-deception). In addition, you can use the extensive datasets in [Miragemaker](/deception/understanding-miragemaker-module) to make decoys more realistic-looking and scalable.
Detect Threats
When an attacker infiltrates your network and interacts with the decoys, Deception detects threats, collects information on the attacker’s actions and intentions, and generates high-fidelity and real-time alerts.
Investigate
When alerts appear on the Deception Admin Portal, Deception captures threat intelligence data and reconnaissance activity in real time. ThreatParse conducts natural language reconstruction of attacks, summarizes log information, and translates it into plain English to help the security operation center (SOC) and analysts understand what the attacker is trying to accomplish. SOCs and analysts can correlate this data to generate threat intelligence and take necessary actions to stop lateral movement.
Orchestrate
Based on high-fidelity data, Deception lets you orchestrate (automate) and build rules to take immediate actions when events are discovered to contain threats.
Remediate
When the attacker’s intended targets are uncovered, Deception deploys additional decoys to validate remediation.
