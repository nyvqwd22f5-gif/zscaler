The Chronology page provides a temporal overview and heatmap of the attacker's activities. This information helps you to identify periods of activity with unusual volumes of alerts. The Chronology page provides graphical representations of the number of events generated in Zscaler Deception over time. This help you gain insights into attackers' activity using the weekly heatmap generated based on the volume of activity during the time of day.
You can access the Chronology page from the [extended details](/deception/viewing-extended-details) page of an entity on the dashboard.

The Chronology page includes:
- Events over time graph: When an attacker infiltrates your network and interacts with the decoys, Deception generates events. This graph shows these events over a specified period of time.
- Activity over a week graph: This graph shows a heatmap that helps you to analyze the attacker's activity pattern for a weekly duration. A brighter spot on the graph represents a high volume of activity.
