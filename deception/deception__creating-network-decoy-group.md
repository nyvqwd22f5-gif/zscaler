A network decoy group allows you to logically organize networks and threat intelligence decoys based on function, location, system type, etc. A decoy group categorizes the detected alerts along logical boundaries. You can create a network decoy group based on:
- Business functions, such as HR, Legal, IT, Accounts, etc.
- Geographic regions, such as USA, APAC, EU, etc.
- System types, such as desktops, laptops, servers, etc.
You can create a network group from the Deceive Settings page or when [creating a network decoy](/deception/creating-internal-network-decoy).
To create a network decoy group:
- Go to **Deceive** > **Deceive Settings** > **Network Decoy Groups**.
- Click **Add Decoy Group**.
- In the **Network Decoy Group Details** window, enter a name for the group and click **Submit**.
