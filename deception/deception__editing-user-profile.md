The user profile consists of your name and time zone. It is configured when an administrator provisions an account for you in the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal.
Zscaler Deception uses your profile information to configure the portal as follows:
- Your name is displayed during specific configurations. It is also used when submitting a ticket to Zscaler Support.
- The time zone is used when sending automated email alerts.
To edit your user profile:
-
Click the **Account Settings** icon (![Icon for Account Settings](/downloads/deception/deceive/network-decoys/creating-internal-network-decoy/zscaler-deception-advanced-settings-icon-new.png)
