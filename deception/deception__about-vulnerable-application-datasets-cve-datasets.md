Vulnerable Application Datasets (CVE Datasets) allow you to configure requests and responses to mimic dynamic web applications that are deployed using threat intelligence decoys and network decoys. Typically, the requests and responses are created based on CVE disclosures for the specific application to lure an attacker into believing that they are interacting with a vulnerable application. However, you can also create custom requests and responses for dynamic web applications that mimic any vulnerability, even if there is no CVE disclosure for the vulnerability.
Vulnerable application datasets provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure requests and responses based on CVE disclosures or any other vulnerability to mimic the behavior of legitimate web applications.
- Make dynamic web application decoys appear more legitimate and vulnerable to lure bad actors and contain attacks in the early phases.
About the Vulnerable Application Datasets (CVE Datasets) Page
On the Vulnerable Application Datasets (CVE Datasets) page (Miragemaker > Vulnerable Application Datasets (CVE Datasets)), you can do the following:
- View the list of prepopulated and custom vulnerable application datasets, and search for a specific entry by name. For each vulnerable application dataset, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the vulnerable application dataset.
- **Vulnerability Classification**: The classification of the vulnerability mimicked by the vulnerable application dataset.
- **CVE ID**: The CVE identifier associated with the publicly disclosed vulnerability configured in the application dataset.
- **Linked Dynamic Applications**: The list of all dynamic applications that are configured with the vulnerable application dataset.
- **Description**: The description of the vulnerable application dataset.
