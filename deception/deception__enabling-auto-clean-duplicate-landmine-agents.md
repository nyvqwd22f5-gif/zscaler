You can enable the auto clean-up feature to automatically delete landmine agents with duplicate hostnames from the [Agent Configuration ](/deception/about-landmine-settings)page. The most recently connected hostnames and the ones that are connected for less than 7 days are retained.
Landmine agents deleted via auto clean-up are not uninstalled from the system. You have to manually uninstall them.
To enable the auto clean-up of duplicate landmine agents:
- Go to **Settings **> **Endpoint Settings **> **Agent Configuration**.
-
Under the **Auto Clean-Up Duplicate Agents **section, select **Enabled**.
[See image.](#zd-landmine-auto-cleanup)
- Click **Save**.
