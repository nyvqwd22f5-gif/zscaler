The Network page shows information about the attacker's activity on your network based on the telemetry generated by network decoys. It displays a graph that shows the path that an attacker has used to interact with the network decoys. It lists event logs that include the attacker's IP address, decoy IP address and port, network protocol, network service, and network connection duration.
The attack network graph helps you to understand the attacker's behavior. Analyze the attack pattern and the attacker's behavior using the graph that shows the network path used by the attacker to interact with the decoy. You can filter the event logs as necessary and combine the information on the graph and logs to identify how and when the attack happened. In addition, you can leverage the log information recorded for the event to correlate this data with the graph to gain better insights into the attack.
You can access the Network page from the [extended details](/deception/viewing-extended-details) page associated with an entity on the dashboard.

The Network page includes:
- Network Graph: Shows the attack path from the initial node to the target node that describes the attacker's specific attack behaviors. You can also drag the cursor and select an area on the graph to filter events.
-
Filtered Event Logs: Shows logs filtered per your selection on the graph. Click the log entry to see all the details available for the event.

-
PCAP: Provides options to build and download a consolidated packet capture file (PCAP) that has evidence of attack for the specified time period. To download the PCAP file, click **Build **from the **PCAP **drop-down menu. After the file is built, **Download Available PCAP** appears in the PCAP drop-down menu. Click **Download Available PCAP **to download the PCAP file.
