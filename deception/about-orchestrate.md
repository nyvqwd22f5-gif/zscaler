The Orchestrate feature enables integration with leading security solutions to forward events, contain threats, and enrich security events.
The Orchestrate feature provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Configure condition-based rules to automate workflows, notifications, and response actions using containment integration tools.
- Integrate third-party tools and solutions for event data enrichment, containment of attackers, and analysis of data using security information and event management (SIEM) solutions.
- Configure API tokens for programmatic access, event templates, and service connectors to forward data to SIEM solutions.
