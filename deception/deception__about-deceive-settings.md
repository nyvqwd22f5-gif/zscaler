The Deceive Settings page allows you to create a firewall rule to blocklist IP addresses from accessing decoys, store credentials submitted by adversaries as SHA256 hashes, resolve hostnames and NetBIOS names of the adversaries, and create decoy groups to logically organize network and threat intelligence decoys.
Deceive Settings provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure a blocklist of IPs and ports whose traffic should not be processed or stored by Zscaler Deception.
- Hash and store all passwords submitted by attackers to application decoys.
- Configure DNS-based or NetBIOS-based name resolution of the attackers' identity.
- Create and manage network decoy groups.
