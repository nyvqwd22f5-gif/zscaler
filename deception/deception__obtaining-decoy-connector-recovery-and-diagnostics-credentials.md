After you [add and connect a Decoy Connector to the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal](/deception/adding-connecting-decoy-connector-admin-portal), its recovery and diagnostic passwords are randomized. You can obtain the new credentials from the Deception Admin Portal.
Only users with the Superadmin role can view recovery credentials. To learn more about roles, see [About Users & Roles](/deception/about-users-roles#deception-user-role-about-role).
To obtain the recovery and diagnostics credentials:
- Go to **Settings** > **Topology** > **Decoy Connectors.**
-
Select the Decoy Connector for which you want to obtain the credentials, and then click **Actions** > **Credentials**.
