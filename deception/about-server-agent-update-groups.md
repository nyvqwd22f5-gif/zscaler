After a server agent update is released, all agents are updated as soon as they connect with the Zscaler ITDR Admin Portal. However, you can also perform phased updates by creating server agent update groups with criteria to selectively roll out the updates.
Server agent update groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create criterion-based groups for server agents to roll out updates.
- Manage phased updates for each server agent update group individually.
About the Agent Update Groups Page
On the Agent Update Groups page (Settings > Server Agent Settings > Agent Update Groups), you can do the following:
- [Enable the phased updates ](/itdr/enabling-phased-updates-using-server-agent-update-groups)for the server agent update groups.
- [Add a server agent update group](/itdr/adding-server-agent-update-group).
- View a list of server agent update groups that you have created. For each agent update group, you can view:
- **Name**: The name of the server agent update group.
- **Selection Criterion**: The selection criterion specified for the [server agent update group](/itdr/adding-server-agent-update-group).
- **Update Progress**: The total number of server agents updated in the group.
- **Update Enabled**: The status of phased updates. The **X** icon indicates that the updates are disabled for the group, and the checkmark icon indicates that the updates are enabled for the group.
