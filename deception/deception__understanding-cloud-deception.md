Cloud Deception is a set of tools that allow you to configure and deploy decoys that mimic legitimate resources and assets in public cloud platforms. You can integrate a supported public cloud platform with Zscaler Deception and deploy decoy resources specific to the cloud platform. Depending on the type of decoy and its configuration, an adversary can access, interact, or perform malicious operations with the cloud decoys in different ways. Such activities are considered malicious activities and they are logged as attacks. You can view and analyze the attack details from the Deception dashboard.
Deploying Decoys
You can deploy Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS) decoys to detect malicious activities originating from adversaries within or outside your organization, depending on the type and configuration of the decoys. For example, lures for Azure or AWS decoys configured using landmine policies detect malicious activities by users within an organization, as the landmine policies are deployed in devices managed by the organization. On the other hand, decoys with public visibility can detect malicious activities from external adversaries who enumerate them with various tools.
Deception uses a deployment script to set up the integration and deploy decoys in the Azure or AWS cloud. For Azure, the script deploys all necessary resources such as secrets, resource groups, function apps, etc., to manage Cloud Deception with Azure. A health check function app is also deployed that monitors and updates the health status of the deployed decoys to the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal every 15 minutes. For AWS, the script deploys all necessary resources such as functions, users, policies, etc. to manage Cloud Deception with AWS. A health check lambda function is also deployed that monitors and updates the health status of the deployed decoys to the Deception Admin Portal every 15 minutes.
