You can export server agent configuration details as a CSV or JSON file. The configuration details include information about all the installed server agents, or the server agents filtered by the system on which it is installed, OS version of the system, server agent version, and IP address of the server.
Use the search field in the table columns to filter the agents. For example, in the Search field of the **System Name **column, enter the system name to filter agents.

To export server agents' configuration details:
- Go to **Settings **> **Server Agent Settings **> **Agents**.
-
Select an option from the **Export** drop-down menu:
- **All agents as CSV**: Exports the configuration details of all agents as a CSV file.
-
**All agents as JSON**: Exports the configuration details of all agents as a JSON file.
These two options allow you to export only the agents that are shown in the table. The table displays only the active server agents. If you want to export all agents including the inactive agents, enable the **Show All Agents **option.
