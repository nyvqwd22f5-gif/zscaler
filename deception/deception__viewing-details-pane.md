On the Investigate page, you can click any element on the alert graph to view the details pane that shows all attacker activities on the system. The details pane is unique for each Zscaler Deception object (Zscaler Deception Admin Portal, Decoy Connector, Decoy Group, and Decoy) and attacker.
Zscaler Deception Object Details Pane
The Deception object details pane shows you ThreatParse rules that are triggered by attackers connecting to that object. It includes the risk scores assigned to attackers. This information enables the security teams to prioritize the most pressing threats first and take necessary actions to stop lateral movement.
Click **View Extended Details** to view the in-depth analysis of attack activities carried out against the selected deception object. To learn more, see [Viewing Extended Details](/deception/viewing-extended-details).
