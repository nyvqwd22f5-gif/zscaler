You can leverage single or combined Deception strategies to build and deploy environments with a single click. You can choose to deploy these strategies using [Internal](/deception/creating-internal-network-decoy) or [Zero Trust Network (ZTN)](/deception/creating-zero-trust-network-decoy) decoys.
Deploy Strategy provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Build and deploy sophisticated environments in a single click with one or more Deception strategies using internal or ZTN decoys.
- Customize and manage the environment by modifying the deployed strategies.
