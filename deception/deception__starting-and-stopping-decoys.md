Before you configure a network (Internal and Zero Trust Network) or Threat Intelligence (TI) decoy, you must stop all active decoys, make the required changes, and then restart the decoys for the configurations to take effect.
Starting and stopping decoys impacts network and TI decoys only. Other decoys such as Landmine, Active Directory (AD), etc. are not impacted.
