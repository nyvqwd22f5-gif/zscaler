The Investigate module allows you to track, analyze, and manage all events generated by decoys. The dashboard on the Investigate page provides a visualization of all events, decoys, Decoy Connectors, and App Connectors, along with a graphical representation of how these entities are connected to each other and to the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal.
The Investigate module enhances user experience by providing:
- Visibility into attacker behavior through real-time alerts and detailed component views.
- Comprehensive forensic analysis with access to ThreatParse data, event logs, network telemetry, and evidence files.
- Accelerated response capabilities, enabling teams to take swift actions such as containment, blocking, or marking threats as safe.
- Improved threat detection accuracy by correlating attacker activities across multiple deception components.
- Reduced response time, helping teams act decisively before threats escalate.
- Strengthened overall security posture through integrated threat intelligence and streamlined workflows.
About the Investigate Page
On the Investigate page, you can do the following:
- Filter the events shown in the alerts area using queries and predefined time ranges. You can build complex queries using the purpose-built query language. To learn more, see [Understanding and Building Queries](/deception/understanding-and-building-queries).
- View a graphical representation of all events and the components to which they are connected in the alerts area.
- Manually filter the events that were generated over a specific time period. In addition, you can see how the events were generated sequentially.
- Customize the dashboard by filtering events based on level of details, threat level, decoy type, etc.

Interacting with Events and Components
The components shown in the alerts area are interactive. Click any of them to view the details pane, and review the ThreatParse rules that are triggered for attacker activity.

When you click an attacker in the details pane, the associated risk score and the timestamps of the first and last events are displayed. You can use the Actions menu to contain, block, or delete threats, or mark an attack as safe, directly from the details pane. To learn more, see [Controlling Threat Events.](https://help.zscaler.com/deception/taking-action-from-the-dashboard)
You can also automate these actions by configuring orchestration rules. To learn more, see[ About Orchestration Rules](/deception/about-orchestration-rules).

To perform a deeper analysis of an event or component, click **View Extended Details** in the details pane. The[ Extended Details](https://help.zscaler.com/deception/viewing-extended-details) window offers insights into:
- **ThreatParse**: Explains the attack using the MITRE ATT&CK  framework and provides a risk score in plain English.
- **Chronology**: Displays a timeline and heatmap of attacker activities.
- **Network**: Shows attacker behavior based on network decoy telemetry.
- **Event Logs**: Contains detailed logs of related events.
- **Evidence**: Offers attack evidence from PCAP, RDP, or IoC files (available only for specific components like Decoy Connectors and App Connectors).
