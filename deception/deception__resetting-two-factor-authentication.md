When signing into the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal for the first time, you must configure two-factor authentication (2FA) using an authenticator app. This adds an extra level of security because you are required to enter both your password and a 2FA code while signing into the portal.
When you have a new device and you want to configure 2FA on it, you can reset the code.
To reset 2FA:
-
Click the **Account Settings** icon (![Icon for Account Settings](/downloads/deception/deceive/network-decoys/creating-internal-network-decoy/zscaler-deception-advanced-settings-icon-new.png)
) in the left-side navigation.
The **Account Settings** page opens.
-
On the **Profile** tab, under **Two-Factor Authentication**, click **Reset 2FA**.

- Click **Save**.
- When a QR code appears, scan it using an authenticator app.
