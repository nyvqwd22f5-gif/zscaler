After a landmine agent update is released, all agents are updated as soon as they connect with the Zscaler Deception Admin Portal. However, you can also perform phased updates by creating agent update groups with criteria to selectively roll out the updates.
Agent Update Groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create criterion-based groups for landmine agents to roll out updates to select groups.
- Manage phased updates for landmine agents for each agent update group individually.
About the Agent Update Groups Page
On the Agent Update Groups page (Settings > Endpont Settings > Agent Update Groups), you can do the following:
- View a list of agent update groups that you have created. For each agent update group, you can view:
- **Name**: The name of the agent update group.
- **Selection Criteria**: The selection criteria specified for the agent update group.
- **Update Progress**: The total number of agents updated in the group.
- **Update Enabled**: The status of phased updates. The **X** icon indicates that the updates are disabled for the group, and the checkmark icon indicates that the updates are enabled for the group.
