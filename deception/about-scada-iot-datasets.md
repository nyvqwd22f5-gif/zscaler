Zscaler Deception allows you to configure network decoys to mimic various Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices used in industrial processes, such as sensors, actuators, and other logical controllers. By default, Zscaler Deception provides a list of datasets that includes device-based datasets to mimic specific SCADA/IoT devices and protocol-based datasets to mimic generic SCADA/IoT devices. You can also create and upload custom SCADA/IoT datasets.
SCADA/IoT datasets provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Set up an active defense in your industrial environments by deploying various SCADA or IoT decoys in your network.
- Leverage existing datasets or create new datasets that mimic SCADA or IoT devices such as sensors, actuators, and other logical controllers.
