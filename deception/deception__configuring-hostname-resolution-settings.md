The Hostname Resolution Settings feature allows you to resolve hostnames (using DNS) and NetBIOS names of the adversaries. You can select the resolution method and the preferred method to use if both methods resolve to different results.
To configure hostname resolution settings:
- Go to **Deceive** > **Deceive Settings** > **Hostname Resolution Settings**.
- On the **Hostname Resolution Settings** tab:
- Enable **Resolve hostname** to enable DNS resolution of the adversaries' hostnames.
- Enable **NetBIOS** **name resolution** to enable NetBIOS resolution of the adversaries' hostname and select the **DNS** or **NetBIOS** option from the **Preferred Method** drop-down menu to resolve hostname using one of the methods.
