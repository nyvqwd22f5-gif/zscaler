The Server Agent Domain feature provides a centralized view of all domains and their associated domain controllers. This feature allows you to monitor the status of domain controllers and their configured capabilities. You can enable session tracking in the server agent policy to monitor logon activities. You can also enable password analysis to identify compromised or weak passwords.
Server agent domains provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View the real-time status of domain controllers.
- Configure the server agent policy to monitor logon activities, enable password analysis for analyzing password vulnerabilities, enable remediation, or threat detection.
