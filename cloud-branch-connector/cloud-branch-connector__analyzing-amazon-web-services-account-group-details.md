The Amazon Web Services (AWS) account group details page provides general and management information for a selected AWS account group. You can access the AWS account group details page by clicking the name of an account group on the [AWS Groups](/cloud-branch-connector/about-amazon-web-services-account-groups) page.
Analyzing the AWS Account Group Details Page
On the AWS account group details page, you can do the following:
- View the name of the account group.
- Edit an account group.
- Delete an account group.
- View the description of the account group.
- From the drop-down menu, select the Cloud Connector groups where tag information is sent.
- Filter the list of accounts by the following criteria:
- **Account ID**
- **Name**
- Search for an account.
- View a list of accounts in the group. For each account, you can view:
- **Account ID**: Select an account ID to access the [AWS account details](/cloud-branch-connector/analyzing-amazon-web-services-account-details) page.
- **Name**: The name of the account.
- **Last Modified By**: The admin who last modified the account.
- **Last Modified On**: The date and time when the account was last modified.
- **Permission**: The permission status of the account:
- **Allowed**: The IAM role was correctly deployed, and the service can discover tags.
- **Denied**: The service cannot assume the role that you provided. Ensure that the role is properly deployed and the trust policy uses the correct Zscaler role and external ID.
- **Pending**: The account was added to the Zscaler service, but it is waiting for the role to be deployed. When the role is deployed and the Zscaler admin syncs it, the role moves into the **Allowed** or **Denied** status.
- Modify the table and its columns.
