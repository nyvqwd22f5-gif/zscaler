Locations identify the various networks from which your organization sends its cloud traffic. When you deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector or Zscaler Branch Connector, the Zscaler service automatically creates a location using a [location template](/cloud-branch-connector/about-location-templates) with defined attributes.
Locations provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Identify the locations and sublocations from which your organization sends its workload traffic.
- Apply forwarding and security policies to workload traffic.
- Configure various settings such as Firewall Control, Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP), Caution, Authentication, and XFF Forwarding.
- Enforce Bandwidth Control and specify the maxiumum bandwidth limits for download and upload.
About the Locations Page
On the Locations page (Administration > Locations), you can do the following:
- Search for a location or sublocation.
- View a list of all locations, the [scope type](/cloud-branch-connector/using-sublocation-scopes-group-cloud-connector-workloads-amazon-web) (if configured), and the number of associated sublocations.
When you click the number in the **Sublocations** column, the **View Sublocation** window appears. You can configure sublocations in the ZIA Admin Portal. To learn more, see[ Understanding Sublocations](/zia/understanding-sub-locations) and [Configuring Sublocations](/zia/configuring-sub-locations).
- Modify the table and its columns.
- [Edit a location](/cloud-branch-connector/editing-deleting-or-duplicating-items).
- Go to the [Location Templates](/cloud-branch-connector/about-location-templates) page.
