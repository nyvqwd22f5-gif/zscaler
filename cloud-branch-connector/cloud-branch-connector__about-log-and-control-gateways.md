The log and control gateway allows you to control and forward traffic logs and operational messages to the Zscaler cloud. A default log and control gateway with a predefined primary and secondary proxy is automatically created.
Log and control gateways provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Give users the ability to control the Zscaler data centers used to forward the logs.
- Allow users to choose the primary and backup Zscaler data centers that are used to forward the logs.
