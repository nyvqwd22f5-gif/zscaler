Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector virtual devices contain a Zscaler Service Account called `zsroot`. This account is a privileged user that enables secure administrative access and management of the virtual device. In order to safeguard your organization, Zscaler strongly recommends implementing routine password rotation as a best practice.
Zscaler Cloud Connector
Zscaler Cloud Connectors are typically accessed with the SSH Key that your cloud provider provides at the creation of the connector. Although your `zsroot` password is not required for logging in, Zscaler recommends periodically changing the password.
- Log in to the VM as user `zsroot`.
- Change the password:
- Enter the following command:
passwd zsroot
- Follow the prompts to enter the current password and then a new password.
Zscaler Virtual Branch Connector
- Log in to the device through the console/management interface as user `zsroot`.
- Change the password:
- Enter the following commands:
ssh zsroot@169.254.2.2passwd zsroot
- Follow the prompts to enter the current password and then a new password.
