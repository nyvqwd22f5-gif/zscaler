Cloud Connector groups are comprised of individual Cloud Connectors and are used to configure policy rules in the ZPA Admin Portal.
Cloud Connector groups provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Apply policies to a group of deployed Cloud Connectors.
- Upgrade Cloud Connectors belonging to a group to maintain redundancy while upgrades are being executed.
Cloud Connector groups listed in the ZPA Admin Portal come from the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. You can create and update Cloud Connector groups in the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. To learn more, see [Accessing and Navigating the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal](/cloud-branch-connector/accessing-navigating-zscaler-cloud-branch-connector-admin-portal).
About the Cloud Connector Groups Page
On the Cloud Connector Groups page (Administration > Cloud Connector groups), you can do the following:
- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to display the filters.
- Refresh the Cloud Connector Groups page to reflect the most current information.
- Filter the Cloud Connector group information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
- Expand all the rows in the table to see more information about each Cloud Connector group.
- View a list of all deployed Cloud Connector groups. For each deployed Cloud Connector group, you can see the name of the Cloud Connector group.
