Microsoft Azure partner integrations enable you to use user-defined tags and resource attributes in Zscaler security policies. To fetch this information from the Azure tenant and subscriptions, you must provide a service principal. Zscaler configuration requires a service account called an Azure account, which maps to service principal credentials that have access to a set of subscriptions in the same tenant.
Tag discovery services for Azure are in Limited Availability (LA). To learn more, contact Zscaler Support.
Partner integrations provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure permissions for Zscaler to discover workloads and associated metadata from a set of Azure subscriptions.
- View discovered workloads and the associated metadata.
- Associate a Cloud Connector with the workload information to enforce Zscaler security policies.
