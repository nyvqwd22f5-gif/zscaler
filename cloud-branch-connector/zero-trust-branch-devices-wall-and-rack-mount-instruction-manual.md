After you receive the Zscaler Branch Connector hardware, you can mount the [Zero Trust SD-WAN Device](/cloud-branch-connector/understanding-zero-trust-branch-devices) as follows:
- The Zero Trust SD-WAN Device 400: Rack posts using the rack mount kit.
- The Zero Trust SD-WAN Device 600: Rack posts using the rack mount kit.
- The Zero Trust SD-WAN Device 800:
- Rack posts using the rack mount kit.
- The wall, using the wall mount kit. Only available upon request.
Mounting on a rack or wall optimizes your workspace and makes your Zero Trust SD-WAN Device more accessible for[ installation ](/cloud-branch-connector/installing-zero-trust-branch-devices)and[ deployment](/cloud-branch-connector/deploying-zero-trust-branch-devices). It protects your device from any external damage and helps streamline the organization of your cables and power adapters. Additionally, rack or wall mounting helps ensure proper airflow, preventing overheating and dust accumulation caused by restricted ventilation. Proper airflow also maintains a cleaner environment, prolonging the lifespan of the device.
