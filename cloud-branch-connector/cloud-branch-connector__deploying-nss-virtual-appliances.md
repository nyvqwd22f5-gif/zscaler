To deploy your NSS virtual appliance, the Zscaler service needs to compute the appropriate resources for your NSS. To learn more, see the deployment guide linked below for your platform:
You must be subscribed to NSS for Firewall, Cloud and Branch Connector to manage your Cloud & Branch Connector NSS.
