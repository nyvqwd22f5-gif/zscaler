Zscaler provides Zero Trust Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) Devices ("Branch Devices") as a subscription service. Zscaler retains ownership of the Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices after shipping them, and maintains and supports the Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices during the subscription term according to this policy and/or applicable documentation. Zscaler offers comprehensive advanced replacement services for Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices as described in this article.
Zero Trust SD-WAN support services are available through the Zscaler Help Portal or the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal (https://connector.<Zscaler Cloud Name>.net/login).
You can find the <Zscaler Cloud Name> in the URL you use to log in to the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. For example, log in to connector.zscaler.net and then go to https://config.zscaler.com/zscaler.net/cloud-branch-connector.

To initiate the Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) process, submit a Branch Connector ticket via the [Zscaler Help Portal](/submit-ticket-links) or the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. Zscaler Support works with you to troubleshoot and diagnose issues remotely. If the issue cannot be resolved remotely or is determined to be a hardware fault, Zscaler might decide to replace the Zero Trust SD-WAN Device.
Zscaler Support does the following to continue the RMA process:
- Requests the following information:
- Company name
- Organization ID (Org ID)
- Shipping address
- Contact name, phone number, and email address
- Product model, serial, and asset tag numbers
- Creates an RMA number for tracking purposes.
- Ships a replacement device with a return shipping label included.
A return shipping label is included with the replacement device. You must package the defective device and ship it to Zscaler within 30 business days of receiving the replacement device. All returned items must have a valid Zscaler RMA number. This number is crucial to ensure the accurate tracking and handling of returned items. For any questions related to RMA or shipping, contact the Zscaler logistics team at [z-sc-logistics@zscaler.com](mailto:z-sc-logistics@zscaler.com).
Do not return any hardware until an RMA is issued.
The RMA process is complete after the replacement device is successfully installed and operational and Zscaler receives the defective device.
To install your replacement device, see [Installing Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices](/cloud-branch-connector/installing-zero-trust-branch-devices).
RMA Shipping and Delivery Times
The Service Level Agreement (SLA) for receiving the replacement device depends on your geographic location. In most parts of the world, Zscaler attempts to ship the replacement device within three business days. In regions such as the Middle East and certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia, the shipment might take up to 6 weeks. For details, see the "Return and Replacement" section in [Zero Trust Branch Connector](https://www.zscaler.com/legal/zero-trust-branch-connector-device?_gl=1*628e0t*_gcl_au*MTYwNjkwODA3LjE3MzEwOTM5NTQ.*_ga*MTMxNjc1OTA4MC4xNjM5NzcyMDI5*_ga_10SPJ4YJL9*MTczNDYzMzUyNi42OTcuMS4xNzM0NjMzNzAxLjIxLjAuMzAwNzcyNDc0).
Service Termination
Upon termination or nonrenewal of your subscription agreement, you are responsible for returning all Zero Trust SD-WAN Devices to Zscaler within 60 days at Zscaler's expense. Contact Zscaler Support to arrange return shipping.
Data Removal Obligations
You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to remove any and all data before shipping your devices to Zscaler. Zscaler is not responsible for the security, safeguarding, or return of any data left on devices that have been shipped to Zscaler.
