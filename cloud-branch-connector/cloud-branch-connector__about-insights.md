About the Insights Pages
On the Insights pages, (Analytics > Session/DNS/Tunnel Insights), you can do the following:
- View the [Logs](/cloud-branch-connector/about-insights-logs) tab.
- Clear all filters.
- Click to show or hide the left-side navigation.
- Choose a predefined time frame or select **Custom** to use the calendar and time menus to define your own time frame. In **Custom**, the end date can be up to 92 days after the start date. Selecting multiple days results in seeing the sum of bytes/transactions per day in whichever chart type you select.
- Select a chart type.
- Filter data by unit depending on which Insights page you are viewing:
- Session Insights: Sessions, Bytes

- Click **Apply Filters** to activate your changes.
- Define data types.
- For certain data types, you can choose to view the top 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 items.
- In trend and pie charts, you'll only see the top 5 items. The "Other" category refers to the rest of the data types that are not in the top 5.
- Print the entire sequence of charts in the history bar.
- View the chart and interactively drill down for more information.
- Narrow down the data scope by applying filters.
- View logs for a specific item in the chart. Hover and click it, and then select **Click for more info **to view the Logs.
- View your workflow in the history bar.
As you work with your data, the history bar records the workflow. Each time you make a change to the chart (e.g., add a filter or change the chart type), the portal adds the previous version to the history bar. You can then click any chart in the history bar to see it again. If you view an earlier version and change it, all subsequent versions are automatically deleted. This enables an administrator to review the various stages of the investigation and change direction for the analysis upon review, if necessary. The history bar can retain up to 50 versions of the chart. If there are more than 50 versions, the portal deletes the oldest versions as new ones are added. The chart icons are numbered, so you can track how many versions you have. You can delete charts from your workflow.
