In the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal, the VDI Groups page displays a list of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) device groups that are defined based on criteria entered by an admin. The VDI devices that have Zscaler Client Connector for VDI deployed are categorized under groups based on the match criteria.
VDI groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Apply policies to a group of VDI devices that are grouped using user-defined criteria.
- View the details of the VDI devices contained in a VDI group for information and troubleshooting.
