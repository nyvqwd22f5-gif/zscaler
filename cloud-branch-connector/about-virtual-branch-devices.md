Virtual Branch Devices enable Zero Trust connectivity everywhere for all unauthenticated users, devices, servers, and IoT/OT, regardless of location. Additionally, they eliminate the attack surface by connecting branches and data centers through the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) independent of the underlying WAN transport network.
Virtual Branch Devices provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Ease deployment on any server running VMware or Linux KVM.
- Prevent lateral threat movement, allowing Zero Trust connectivity to build a foundation for secure connectivity that enables east-to-west segmentation.
