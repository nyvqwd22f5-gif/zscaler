You can create gateway objects to configure the proxy gateway feature that enables you to forward traffic to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). A default ZIA gateway with a predefined primary and secondary proxy is automatically created.
ZIA gateways provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Grant users the ability to control the Zscaler data centers where the workload traffic is forwarded.
- Allow users to choose the primary and backup Zscaler data centers to be used for specific workload locations.
