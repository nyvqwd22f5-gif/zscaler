Zscaler Cloud Connector ensures that cloud workloads adhere to organizational security policy when accessing both public and private endpoints. This is achieved by intelligently forwarding traffic to the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) platforms. Cloud Connector also enables multi-cloud connectivity and enforces a security policy for cloud-to-cloud traffic. Cloud Connector is delivered in several form factors. It is available as a virtual appliance in both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, as well as VMs for on-premises deployment. This guide walks you through the AWS deployment.
