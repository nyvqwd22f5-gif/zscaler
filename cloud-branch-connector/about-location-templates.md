A location template is composed of different attributes that are applied to a [location](/unified/about-locations-cloud-branch-connector). Locations are created automatically when you deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector or Zscaler Branch Connector on a cloud. To have a location automatically created from a template, you must select a location template when configuring a Cloud Provisioning Template or Branch Configuration Template. To learn more, see [Configuring a Cloud Provisioning Template](/unified/configuring-cloud-provisioning-template) and [Configuring a Branch Configuration Template](/unified/configuring-branch-configuration-template).
Location templates provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure various settings such as Firewall Control, Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP), Caution, Authentication, and XFF Forwarding.
- Enforce Bandwidth Control and specify the maximum bandwidth limits for download and upload.
- Create a template with preferred default settings that will be enabled for all new locations created using that template.
- Automate location creation.
