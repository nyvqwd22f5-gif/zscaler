Google Cloud Platform (GCP) partner integrations enable you to use user-defined tags and resource attributes in Zscaler security policies. To fetch this information from the GCP tenant and projects, you must provide a service principal. Zscaler configuration requires a service account called a GCP account, which maps to service principal credentials that have access to a set of subscriptions in the same tenant.
Partner integrations provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure permissions for the Zscaler service to discover workloads and associated metadata from a set of GCP projects.
- View discovered workloads and the associated metadata.
- Associate a Cloud Connector with the workload information to enforce Zscaler security policies.
