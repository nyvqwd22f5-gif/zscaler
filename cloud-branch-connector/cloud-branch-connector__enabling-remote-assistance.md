At times, Zscaler Support might need access to your Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal for a limited period to troubleshoot issues. Remote assistance allows Zscaler Support to securely and remotely log in to the portal. This can be done with either view-only or full [admin](/cloud-branch-connector/about-administrator) privileges.
This procedure allows Zscaler Support to access the portal until the specified date.
To enable remote assistance:
- Log in to the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal.
- Go to **Help **>** Remote Assistance**.
[See image.](#HelpWithRemoteAssist_Img)
- In the **Remote Assistance** window, select your access preferences and **User Name Visibility**.
- Select **Enable View-Only Access**, **Enable Full Access**, or both.
After enabling your access preferences, select the amount of time you want the access enabled. Zscaler recommends that you select a length of at least one year when choosing view-only access and at least two days when choosing full access.
- Select either **Obfuscated** or **Visible **for the **User Names** field. By default, this field is set to **Visible**.
Admins with [Remote Assistance Management](/cloud-branch-connector/adding-cloud-connector-roles#remote-assist) enabled for their role can make changes in the **Remote Assistance** window.
