You can use tunnel data types and filters to define the tunnel traffic information that you want to view when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your traffic insights, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/cloud-branch-connector/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
On the **Analytics** >** Tunnel Insights** page, select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the **Add Filter** menu in the left-side navigation.

The **Location** filter lists 200 results at a time. It provides search fields where you can type characters and narrow down the results to match your input.
Data Types and Filters
The following are the tunnel data types and their filters:
- **Location**: Use this filter to view metrics associated with a specific location. The default option for this filter is **All**. You can search for specific locations.
- **Tunnel Destination IP**: Use this filter to view metrics associated with a destination IP address. If you want to filter by multiple IP addresses, you can enter them individually, separated by commas (e.g., 192.0.2.0, 192.0.2.1).
- **Tunnel Source IP**: Use this filter to view metrics associated with a source IP address. If you want to filter by multiple IP addresses, you can enter them individually, separated by commas (e.g., 192.0.2.0, 192.0.2.1).
