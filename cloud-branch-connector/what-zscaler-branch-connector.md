Enabled by the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE), Zscaler Branch Connector is a virtual machine (VM) that simplifies traffic forwarding to Zscaler services. The Zero Trust Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) is deployed as a Branch Connector VM. This supplies branches and data centers with fast and reliable access to the internet and private applications with a direct-to-cloud architecture. Branch Connector works similarly to [Zscaler Cloud Connector](/cloud-branch-connector/what-zscaler-cloud-connector).
Branch Connector eliminates the network attack surface by establishing direct branch-to-internet and branch-to-private app connections using a full proxy architecture. It also simplifies branch communications by eliminating complex routing, virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewalls while allowing for flexible forwarding and simple policy management by using the proven Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) policy framework.
All branch communications forward directly to the ZTE, where [ZIA](/zia/policies) or [ZPA](/zpa/policies) policies can be applied for full security inspection and access identity-based control of branch and data center communications. The communications then forward from the ZTE to any destination (i.e., internet, private applications in a public cloud, on-premises data center, etc.).
Key Features and Benefits
The following are some key Branch Connector features and benefits:
- Enables Zero Trust Everywhere: All users, devices, servers, Internet of Things (IoT), and Operational Technology (OT) have explicit access based on continuous identity and context validation.
- Secure Connection: Every office, data center, multi-cloud, and SaaS is secured by building a foundation for connectivity that enables east-west segmentation, preventing lateral threat movement.
- Eliminates Attack Surfaces: Branches and data centers connect directly to each other through the ZTE, independent of their underlying corporate network, VPN, or WAN.
- Purpose-Built, Multi-tenant Proxy Architecture: Holds, inspects, and enforces policy.
- Delivers High-Performance Inspection: Uses a single scan multi-action (SSMA) architecture for an optimal inspection.
- Enforcement: Finely grained forwarding policies for internet and non-internet traffic using ZIA or ZPA.
- Standardized Policy: Policy across branches, data centers, and multi-cloud locations is uniform. This includes policy management, traffic monitoring, and log tracking.
- Device Classification: Allows deeper visibility into behavior for better access control policies.
- Predefined Template: Allows zero touch provisioning and automated deployment.
- Granular Forwarding Policy: Applies to internet and private application traffic to ZIA, ZPA, or Direct (bypassing Zscaler services).
- Service Continuity: Ensures high availability automatic failover with N+1 redundancy.
- Centralized Visibility and Granular Logging: Provides device health and traffic monitoring information.
- Identity and Application-Based Communication: Users move from network-based VPN connectivity to Zero Trust security.
- Elimination of Legacy Products: Eliminates legacy castle-and-moat architecture without compromising security, so there is no need for legacy products (i.e., Squid proxies, NAT gateways, IPSs, etc.).
- Scalable Connectivity: Accessible where necessary with centralized, automated policy management to simplify branch and data center communications.
Zero Trust SD-WAN and Branch Connector Use Cases
The Zero Trust SD-WAN and Branch Connector capabilities are as follows:
- Direct Internet Access Enablement for Branches: As organizations migrate apps to the cloud, on-premises networking and security model effectiveness decreases. Zero Trust SD-WAN is a purpose-built solution for branch transformation, where branches communicate with any destination independent from their underlying network.
- Site-to-Site VPN Replacement: Connect your branches directly to private applications without extending your WAN or relying on VPNs. Applications are hidden behind the branches and access is restricted via the ZTE to a set of named entities. Identity, context, and policy adherence are verified before access is allowed, eliminating the risk of lateral movement.
- Shadow IoT and OT Visibility: Undiscoverable devices create blind spots when they connect to office networks, causing vulnerability and a broader attack surface. Zero Trust SD-WAN identifies and classifies devices to give IT teams visibility into behavior for better access control policies.
- Zero Trust for Server, IoT, and OT Connectivity: To maximize production uptime and avoid disruptions, IoT and OT assets need to be regularly accessed by employees and third-party vendors. Zero Trust SD-WAN for IoT provides remote desktop access to internal Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) target systems without installing a client on a device.
- Mergers and Acquisitions: With Zero Trust SD-WAN, networks can remain separate and branch locations can connect to private applications without disruption.
