Zero Trust Branch Devices are installed in your organization’s on-premises locations such as branches and data centers. They enable Zero Trust connectivity from any unauthenticated users, servers, or IoT/OT devices in any location or over any network. To learn more, see [Understanding Zero Trust Branch Devices](/cloud-branch-connector/understanding-zero-trust-branch-devices).
Zero Trust Branch Devices provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Use Zero Trust Branch Devices everywhere for all unauthenticated users, devices, servers, and IoT/OT regardless of location.
- Eliminate the attack surface by connecting branches and data centers through the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) independent of the underlying wide area network (WAN) transport network.
- Prevent lateral threat movement because the ZTE builds a foundation for secure connectivity that enables east-to-west segmentation.
