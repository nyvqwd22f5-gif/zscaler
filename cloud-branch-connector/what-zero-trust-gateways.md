The Zscaler Zero Trust Gateway service transforms how you can secure your workloads and workload traffic deployed in public clouds. Built on the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE), the Zero Trust Gateway service simplifies cloud workload security for enterprises.
Key Features and Benefits
The Zero Trust Gateway service shares [Zscaler Cloud Connector features and benefits](/cloud-branch-connector/what-zscaler-cloud-connector). Additionally, the following are key Zero Trust Gateway features and benefits:
- Simplifies operations to install, configure, and manage workload security as a SaaS service in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- Offers consistent and comprehensive threat and data protection with common security policies and cloud-scale TLS inspection.
- Reduces the attack surface by connecting applications instead of networks and applying least-privilege access.
- Supports cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-data-center, and region-to-region implementations, which reduces operational costs and complexity.
- Secures workload connections to the internet or to other workloads.
- Reduces cost by allowing traffic forwarded to the Zero Trust Gateway to egress to the internet and/or Zscaler cloud from the Zscaler AWS account.
- Eliminates lateral threat movement.
- Provides Layer 4 security controls for east-west traffic, including subnet to subnet and virtual private cloud (VPC) to VPC communication in the AWS cloud. Layer 4 controls are also used to secure ingress traffic for public applications hosted in AWS, offering a unified view for flow-level visibility and control and the added flexibility of leveraging tag-based policies for Layer 4 controls.
