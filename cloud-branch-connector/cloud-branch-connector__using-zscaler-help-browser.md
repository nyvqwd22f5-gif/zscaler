The Zscaler Help Browser is available for all pages within the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. Through the Help Browser, you can view Zscaler Help Portal articles in context with the page you are on, without leaving the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal.
To open the Help Browser:
- Go to the page where you want to view an article.
- Click **Help** in the lower-right corner.

About the Help Browser
The Help Browser is also adjustable. There are different features to help you customize the browser and navigate within it.
Customizing the Help Browser
You can customize the Help Browser as follows:
- [Resize the browser window](#resize)
- [Change the font size](#fonts)
Zscaler saves your customization until you log out or the session expires.
Navigating within the Help Browser
You can customize the Help Browser as follows:
- Go to the home page (i.e., the initial article relevant to the page you are viewing), navigate back and forth across articles you've viewed within the Help Browser, search for an article, or copy the article's URL to your clipboard.
- Open the article in a new tab.
- Close the Help Browser.
Closing the Help Browser clears your navigation history. When you reopen the Help Browser, it displays the article relevant to the page you are viewing, and you cannot navigate back and forth between articles you've viewed in the previous browser session.
[]You can resize the Help Browser to expand videos, pictures, and content. When you hover to the top-left corner of the browser, an **Expand** cursor appears. Click and drag the corner to resize the window.
[]There are a variety of font sizes for the Help Browser. You can click the **Font** icons to increase or decrease the text size.
