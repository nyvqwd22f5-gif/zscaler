The first time you log in to the Zcaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal, the End User Subscription Agreement (EUSA) appears. Click **Accept** to accept the EUSA. However, if you click **Cancel** and don't accept the EUSA, the Zscaler service puts your account in an "agreement pending" state. You can configure policies and add users, but your changes won't activate, and you can't browse the internet through the service until you accept the EUSA.
If you don't accept the EUSA, a notification appears at the top of the portal. It appears every time you log in until you accept the EUSA.

Click the notification to view the EUSA. After you accept it, the notification disappears. You can read the [full EUSA](https://www.zscaler.com/legal/end-user-subscription-agreement) at any time.
