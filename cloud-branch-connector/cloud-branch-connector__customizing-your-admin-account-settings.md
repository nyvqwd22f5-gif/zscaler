The Zscaler service automatically creates a profile for each administrator account.
To view your profile or change your password:
- Log in to the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal.
- Click the **User** icon in the bottom-left corner of the left-side navigation. The **My Profile** page appears.

- On the **My Profile** page:
- **User Display Name**: View your login ID assigned when your admin account was created.
- **Password**: Click to change your password for the portal. The Zscaler service applies the strongest restrictions and complexity. The password must contain at least 8 characters and include one number, one uppercase character, and one special character. Only ASCII characters are allowed.
- **Language**: From the drop-down menu, select French, German, Japanese, Spanish, or Simplified Chinese. By default, the portal is displayed in English.
- **Timezone**: From the drop-down menu, select your time zone for the portal. This allows you to download logs in your preferred time zone.
- **Forwarding Information**: Enable to display forwarding descriptions at the top of each forwarding window in the portal.
- Click **Save** and [activate the change](/cloud-branch-connector/saving-and-activating-changes).
