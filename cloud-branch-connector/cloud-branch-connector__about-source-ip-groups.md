Grouping source IP addresses together facilitates their use in policies.
Source IP Groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure security and forwarding policies for a group of workloads in a single policy using their source IP addresses.
- Add and remove source workloads from a group without requiring a new security policy.
