Zscaler’s role-based administration enables you to assign ZIdentity users or user groups with admin roles and permissions and control their level of access to the ZIdentity Admin Portal.
There are two predefined admin roles:
- Super Admin: System role with full permissions. You can assign this role to other admins if required.
- View Only Admin: System role view only permissions.
You cannot delete the predefined roles.
Ensure that you have [added users](/zidentity/adding-users) and [user groups](/zidentity/adding-user-groups) to the ZIdentity Admin Portal before assigning necessary admin roles.
For ZIdentity tenants who have migrated to Experience Center, you must have at least the View Only permission for the Users and User Groups modules to submit a Zscaler Support ticket from within Experience Center.
Role management provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Assign users and user groups as admins to manage tasks in the ZIdentity Admin Portal.
- View all the configured admins, their access levels, and functional scope.
