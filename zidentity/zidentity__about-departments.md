This article describes how to add and manage departments. When you add administrators, you can define their scope by department. Administrators can have control over a set of users in a department. An administrator can belong to only one department.
Departments provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage admins and users based on their departments.
- View department-based reports.
- Categorize users based on departments specific to your organization.
On the Departments page (Directory > Departments), you can do the following:
- [Add a department](/zidentity/adding-departments).
- [Import departments using a CSV file](/zidentity/adding-departments).
- View the list of configured departments. For each department, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the department.
- **Description**: A short description about the department.
- [Edit a department](/zidentity/editing-or-deleting-items).
- [Delete a department](/zidentity/editing-or-deleting-items).
- Search for a specific department.
- Refresh the page.
