The following table lists the HTTP status codes returned by the API.
-

-
| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 200 | Successful |
| 304 | Empty Response. This code is returned when the unique identifier of an Etag is passed in an optional If-None-Match header when making a GET request. This allows you to check the server for status updates about a requested resource. If the Etag value matches the cached entry, an empty response (code 304) is returned. If the Etag value does not match the cached entry, a successful response (code 200) with new data is returned.
Passing an Etag header returns a successful response (code 200) with a hashed unique identifier of the Etag in the response. The unique identifier of the Etag can be passed in a request using an If-None-Match header to get a specifically cached response if it still exists in the cache. |
| 400 | Invalid or Bad Request. This code is returned due to one of the following reasons:
The API key name already exists.
An invalid group name is provided.
The request format is invalid due to invalid parameters or parameter values. |
| 401 | Unauthorized. This code is returned due to one of the following reasons:
The API key is revoked.
The JWT token is corrupted. |
| 403 | Forbidden |
| 429 | Exceeded the rate limit or quota |
| 500 | Internal Server Error. To assist with troubleshooting, this code returns an optional response header. A correlation ID is included in both the response header (x-correlation-id) and in the response body. The following example shows a sample response body with the `correlationId`:
500 - Internal Server Error
{
---
correlationId: “xxxx-xxx-xx”
}
For assistance with understanding the internal server error, contact Zscaler Support and provide the correlation ID to learn more. |
