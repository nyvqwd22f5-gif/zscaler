At times, Zscaler customers facing any issues in their ZIdentity Admin Portal can contact Zscaler Support for assistance. Zscaler Support can access the customer's portal remotely for a limited period of time to evaluate and resolve the issue.
A ZIdentity admin with the Super Admin role can enable remote access for Zscaler Support.
To enable remote assistance:
- In the left-side navigation, click **Remote Assistance**.
-
On the **Remote Assistance** page, enable any of the following options depending on your requirements:
- **Enable View Only Access**: Enable and select the date of validity. Zscaler Support can only view the issue in the customer's ZIdentity Admin Portal for the selected number of days.
- **Enable Full Access**: Enable and select the date of validity. Zscaler Support has full access to the customer's ZIdentity Admin Portal for the selected number of days.
