The Linked Services page shows your subscribed Zscaler service tenants. If a tenant is unlinked, the users under that tenant can't access the Zscaler admin portals via ZIdentity.
Service linking provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Individually view your organization level access to the Zscaler admin portals via the ZIdentity service.
- Get a clear idea of ZIdentity enablement status for your organizations.
