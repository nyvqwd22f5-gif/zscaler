You can add users to ZIdentity by creating them [locally within the ZIdentity Admin Portal](/zidentity/adding-users) or via an [external identity provider (IdP) provider](/zidentity/about-external-identity-providers). In addition, you can assign them [admin entitlements](/zidentity/about-administrative-entitlements) to make them administrators for a Zscaler service, such as Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), or Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX), or you can assign them [service entitlements](/zidentity/about-service-entitlements) so they are able to authenticate to a Zscaler service (e.g., ZIA, ZPA, or ZDX) as an end user.
Managing users provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Control which users within your organization are service admins or assigned to a Zscaler service.
- Assign users to a single or multiple Zscaler services.
- Assign users with administrator roles to manage specific Zscaler services.
- Manage all users in ZIdentity instead of maintaining individual user databases in each of the subscribed Zscaler services.
