In the ZIdentity Admin Portal, Audit Logs page data is organized and displayed in a table. You can modify the default settings for the table. Every time you make a change, the settings are stored in your browser's local storage so that your changes are preserved the next time you log in.
If you clear your cache or use a different browser, your settings are lost.
You can do the following:
- [Reorder columns](#reorder)
- [Resize columns](#resize)
- [Hide columns](#hide)
- [Sort the column data](#sort)
- [Reset table to default settings](#reset)
[]When you hover over a listed column name in the settings, a **Move** cursor appears. Drag and drop the column to the desired position. After you drop the column name, the table refreshes and displays the data in the new column order.

[]When the data in a column takes up more space than the viewing area allows, it gets clipped. You can view the clipped data in the tooltip. You can also increase the column width.
To increase the column width, hover over the right border of the column. A resize icon appears. Drag and drop to the desired column width.

[]When you do not need to view all the columns at once, you can hide some columns and view only the required columns.
To hide a column, hover over the **Column Menu** icon on the top right of the table and deselect the column names you wish to hide. The table refreshes and displays only the selected columns.
For tables under the **Policy** and **Administration **pages, you must have at least one column visible at all times. For **Insight log** tables, you can **Deselect All** columns and render the table empty.

[]When you hover over different column headers, you can see that some columns have an arrow icon next to them. These arrows indicate that you can sort the data in those columns. You can sort data in ascending or descending order.
To sort a column, click the arrow in the table column header.
[]After you change the column settings, if you want to revert to the default settings, hover over the **Column Menu** and click the **Reset** icon. This will only reset the columns but not reset the data that was sorted earlier.
