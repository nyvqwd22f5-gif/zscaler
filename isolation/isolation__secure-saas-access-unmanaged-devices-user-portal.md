Organizations can allow unmanaged devices access to sanctioned SaaS applications while still enforcing the [isolation policies](/zpa/about-isolation-policy) you define on Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). The isolation containers that are created as a result of a ZPA Isolation policy can forward to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) any internet traffic or application traffic not defined on ZPA for further processing and enforcement of necessary policies. Any traffic generated by applications defined on ZPA will continue to be forwarded via [ZPA’s ZTNA service](/zpa/universal-ztna-zscaler-private-access-private-service-edge).

Define a SaaS Application as a ZPA Browser Access Application
SaaS applications are typically accessed using a URL that has a domain your organization does not own, such as zscaler70-dev-ed.lightning.force.com. Because the admin does not own this domain, they must define an application segment with an application using a placeholder domain as shown below.
In the above example, the admin created an application segment named “Isolated SaaS Application” and an application using an Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) in a DNS namespace that they own, which is salesforce.safemarch.com. They are transforming the domain to zscaler70-dev-ed.lightning.force.com, which is the true FQDN used by the SaaS application that they intend to provide isolated access to. They have ensured that the application defined is configured for browser access. To learn more, see [About Browser Access](/zpa/about-browser-access) and [Configuring Defined Application Segments](/zpa/configuring-application-segments).

Create an Isolation Policy
After the application is defined with the necessary configurations, an admin can define an isolation policy that isolates the application segment they just created. To learn more, see [About Isolation Policy](/zpa/about-isolation-policy).
[See image.](#Add-Isolation-Policy)
Ensure that the isolation profile you select while defining the isolation policy has the **Forward Internet Traffic via ZIA** option enabled under the **Company Settings** tab. If the option is not enabled, the SaaS application traffic generated from the isolated browser is not forwarded via ZIA and the traffic is not inspected, logged, or enforced with the policies defined on ZIA. To learn more, see [Creating Isolation Profiles for ZPA](/isolation/creating-isolation-profiles-zpa).

Test SaaS Application in Isolation
From an unmanaged device using a browser, such as a device that does not have Zscaler Client Connector running, try accessing the placeholder domain that you used to create the application segment from an unmanaged device using a browser. If the application is correctly configured for browser access, you are prompted to authenticate with your identity provider (IdP), which is configured with ZPA. Upon successful authentication, you are redirected to an isolation session and prompted to authenticate to ZIA. Upon successful authentication to ZIA, the isolated browser accesses the original SaaS application URL configured in the application segment that you created, and you can access the SaaS application from the isolated browser.

Publish the SaaS Application on the User Portal
You can create a portal called the [User Portal](/zpa/about-user-portals) for users to access as a catalog of applications published via the ZPA Browser Access. Users can access the user portal URL and see the list of all published private and SaaS applications. To learn more, see [About User Portals](/zpa/about-user-portals).
