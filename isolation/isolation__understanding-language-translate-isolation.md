[Zscaler Isolation](/isolation/what-is-isolation) is beneficial to admins who want to provide their users with a secure web page browsing experience. Isolation provides a near-native browsing experience for users by utilizing various browser capabilities, including translation services.
For organizations that have global users, the majority of internet web pages can be served to them in multiple different languages. Common commercial browsers provide the ability to translate a web page from the language that appears by default into the language of the user’s browser. However, when a user accesses the internet through an isolated container via Isolation, some websites may not support the user's preferred language and instead display content based on their default configuration. So, Isolation provides the option for the user to manually select their desired language while in an isolated web page.
Admins can enable translation services for their users per [isolation profile](/isolation/profiles). To learn more, see [Creating Isolation Profiles for ZIA](/isolation/creating-isolation-profiles-zia) and [Creating Isolation Profiles for ZPA](/isolation/creating-isolation-profiles-zpa).
The default language that the isolated web page loads depends on the user's browser language. After the isolation container fully renders, the user can access the translation settings by going to the [Isolation Bar](/isolation/using-isolation-bar-native-browser-experience) or the default options in the [right-click menu](/isolation/using-right-click-menu-isolation). To learn more, see [Using the Isolation Bar in Native Browser Experience](/isolation/using-isolation-bar-native-browser-experience) and [Using the Right-Click Menu in Isolation](/isolation/using-right-click-menu-isolation).
The Language translate window gives users the option to translate the entire web page, or to copy and paste selected text from the web page into the translation text box. They can use the drop-down menu to translate text to any language. To learn more about the language translation service, refer to the [Google Translate website documentation](http://translate.google.com/).

The user must manually chose language translation for each isolated web page that they open.
