Isolation is supported on iOS and Android mobile platforms. When traffic is generated from a mobile browser and triggers a policy on ZPA that has the action as Isolate, that traffic is isolated. Isolation is only intended to work on mobile browser-based applications, not native mobile applications.
Mobile experience in Isolation is only available for Android version 13 and later as well as iOS version 17 and later.
The isolation browser connects to the web application using a mobile user agent and retrieves the mobile version of the web page. The content is rendered in the isolation container and streamed to the mobile device, fitting the format automatically depending on the device. You can also use the same touch capabilities of the mobile onscreen keyboard to interact with the isolated web page. The mobile isolation experience nearly mirrors the desktop experience, with the only differences depending on the capabilities of the mobile device used. The mobile experience has varying support for handling HTML canvas, adjusting screen sizes, touch capabilities, and mobile OS defragmentation depending on the device used in isolation. To learn more, see [Limits in Isolation](/isolation/limits-isolation) and [Transferring and Viewing Files in Isolation](/isolation/transferring-and-viewing-files-isolation).
When in the mobile experience, some functions are in different places, but are still accessible. For example, the ability to type is found by clicking the keyboard icon. This icon appears when you click a field on the web page that allows text input.

All user functions available in the desktop experience of isolation are also available in the mobile experience. You can use the [isolation bar](/isolation/using-isolation-bar-native-browser-experience), enable [different user experience modes](/isolation/user-experience-modes-cloud-browser-isolation), access [network diagnostics](/isolation/accessing-network-diagnostics-isolation), and use [local browser rendering](/isolation/local-browser-rendering-cloud-browser-isolation).
The same [isolation profile](/isolation/profiles) configurations apply to both mobile and desktop isolation experiences. If you experience different capabilities for your profile when in mobile isolation, contact Zscaler Support.
