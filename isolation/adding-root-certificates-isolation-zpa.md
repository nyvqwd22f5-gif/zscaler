The default Zscaler Root Certificate is deployed automatically as a placeholder root certificate for any new isolation profile. However, you can create your own root certificates to use for profiles instead.
To add a root certificate:
- Go to **Certificate Management** > **Root Certificates**.
- On the **Root Certificates** page, click **Add Root Certificate**.
The **Add Root Certificate **window appears.

- In the **Add Root Certificate** window:
- Enter a **Name**.
- Click **Select File** to choose a PEM file.
[See image.](#Add-Root-Cert-window)
- Click **Save**. The page refreshes and the new root certificate displays in the page list.
