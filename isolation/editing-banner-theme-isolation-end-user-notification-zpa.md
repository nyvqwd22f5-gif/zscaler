The Default banner theme is automatically applied to all the isolation profiles in your organization, unless you edit a specific profile to have a different banner theme. You cannot delete the Default banner theme, but you can edit it or edit an existing theme.
To edit a banner theme:
- Go to **Configuration & Control** > **Browser Isolation** > **Isolation Banners**.
- Click the **Edit** button next to the banner theme you want to edit.
The **Edit Isolation Banner** window appears.
