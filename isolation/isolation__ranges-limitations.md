Browsing while in Isolation provides advantages not available in a non-remote browser. However, there are some limitations to using Isolation due to its temporary function.
The navigational limits for Isolation are as follows:
- The file size limit for downloading and uploading files in an isolated session is 1 GB.
- The clipboard size limit for copying and pasting images is 3 MB.
- There is a limit of 10 active sessions per user at a time.
- If an isolation session is idle for 10 minutes, it expires. After the session expires, the page automatically refreshes and signs the user back in. To enable session data to be carried over from an expired session, see [Using Persistent State for Isolation](https://help.zscaler.com/isolation/using-persistent-state-isolation).
