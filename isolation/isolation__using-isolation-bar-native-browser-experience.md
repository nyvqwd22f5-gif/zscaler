In Isolation's [Native Browser Experience Mode](/zia/user-experience-modes-cloud-browser-isolation), users can opt for a typical browser view while still benefiting from the protection of an isolated session.
All capabilities of an isolated session are included when using Native Browser Experience Mode, and are accessible via the isolation bar. The default setting for Native Browser Experience Mode hides the isolation bar from view.
When in the mobile isolation user experience, some of these capabilities are different or limited. To learn more, see [Mobile User Experience in Isolation](/isolation/mobile-user-experience-isolation) and [Limits in Isolation](/isolation/limits-isolation).
Accessing the Isolation Bar
To access the isolation bar:
- Begin an isolated session in Native Browser Experience Mode.
- Hover over the isolation icons to view the following options:
- **Copy to isolation**: If you are using Firefox or Chrome, clicking this icon displays the **Clipboard** of content you have copied during your isolation session. The clipboard is erased after every isolation session has ended.
- **Show isolation bar**: Clicking this icon displays the isolation bar.

The isolation bar appears. From the isolation bar, you can:
- View or copy the Isolation URL. You cannot manually change the Isolation URL.
- Open a new isolated tab.
- Enable or disable **Full Screen Mode**.
- Use **Language Translation** to translate the content of the web page. You can translate the content of an entire page or specific text that you highlight. For the duration of the session, you can click the **Translate** icon in the isolation bar** **or use [the right-click menu](/isolation/using-right-click-menu-isolation) to access the different translation options. The default selected language is English. This function can be enabled by admins [per isolation profile](/isolation/profiles). Google Translate is used to power the translation within the application. To learn more, refer to the [Google Cloud website documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/attribution#overview).
- Print** **web pages, inline content, or files. If printing is disabled for your isolation profile, you cannot print the web page or document that is rendered in isolation. You cannot see the print option from the right-click menu, or the print button in the Isolation Bar. If you try to select the option of File > Print from the browser menu, or enter the key command CTRL/CMD+P shortcut, a message appears noting it is disabled by policy.
- View uploaded or downloaded files in the Protected Storage.
- End the isolation session.
- Access the Isolation Browser Menu. This menu is where you can access the Search function, isolation profile name, and network latency diagnostics for your isolation session.
