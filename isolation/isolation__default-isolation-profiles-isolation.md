Default Isolation profiles are automatically created for any organization using [Isolation](/isolation/what-isolation). This allows a quick setup for your organization without manually creating the first Isolation profile needed for configuring Isolation. It is not required to use the default Isolation profiles for any configuration. They are only used if your organization does not manually create any Isolation profiles.
Editing Default Isolation Profiles
These default Isolation profiles can be edited by admins, but cannot be deleted. To learn more, see [Editing Your Isolation Profile for ZIA](/isolation/editing-your-isolation-profile-zia) and [Editing Your Isolation Profile for ZPA](/isolation/editing-your-isolation-profile-zpa).
Each default Isolation profile is automatically named Default Isolation Profile <Tenant ID> <Cloud Name>.
The only security control automatically enabled for the default Isolation profiles is the ability to [view office files in Isolation](/isolation/transferring-and-viewing-files-cloud-browser-isolation). All other security controls are disabled by default.
To learn more about enabling security controls and configuring Isolation profile details, see [Creating a ZIA Isolation Profile for Isolation](/isolation/creating-zia-isolation-profile-isolation) and [Creating a ZPA Isolation Profile for Isolation](/isolation/creating-isolation-profiles-zpa).
