The isolation browser trusts all the well-known certificate authorities trusted by Chromium. In addition, Zscaler also provides administrators with the capability to upload root certificates of their choice that they want the isolated browser to trust for successful SSL communication. These uploaded certificates can be associated with the isolation profiles that are created on the Secure Internet and SaaS Access (ZIA) Admin Portal. To learn more, see [Creating Isolation Profiles for ZIA](/isolation/creating-zia-isolation-profile-isolation).
