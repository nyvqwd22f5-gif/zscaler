Users can access bookmarks from their original browser while in an isolated session. The URL of the bookmarked web page appears as an isolation URL in the isolated browser during the session.
The user can share these bookmarkable isolation URLs with other users in their organization as well as third parties.
If a user shares the bookmarked isolation URL with another user, the other user sees a redirect notice. Upon confirmation, they are redirected to the original URL that show the non-isolated web page. .
