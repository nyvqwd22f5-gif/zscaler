[Read-only mode in Isolation is a setting admins can enable per isolation profile in their organization. This setting restricts the use of a user's keystrokes while in isolation. Isolation profiles with this setting enabled cannot enter text anywhere on the page, paste copied text into text fields, or use virtual keyboards to insert text. The user can still navigate within an isolated web page using other command keys (`Enter`, `Escape`, and `the arrow keys`).]
[Users attempting to enter text information with this setting enabled are shown an error message.]

If you have read-only mode enabled for your isolation profile and think it is a mistake, contact your Zscaler admin.
