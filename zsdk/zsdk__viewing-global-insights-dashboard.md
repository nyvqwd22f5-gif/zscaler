The Global Insights dashboard displays user device distribution on the Global Device Heatmap and on the interactive Threat Detector global map. View the Overview to garner insights about where your user devices are located and connected to evaluate their digital experience performance. Easily configure your map view based on the registered app selection or adjust the Global Device Heatmap's best, average, or worst latency experience.
On the Global Insights dashboard (Dashboards & Diagnostics > Global Insights):
- **Time range selection**: Select a time range up to the previous three days to collect device data.
- **Global Device Heatmap**: A global map where you can view high network latency based on your selection. You can:
- Select which devices display on the heatmap:
- **Select Registered App**: Select a registered app to filter for devices accessing the application and their latency experience.
- **Heatmap slider**: Adjust the colors for latency experience. Each color represents:
- **Green**: Best latency experience.
- **Yellow**: Average latency experience.
- **Red**: Worst latency experience.
