Configuration graphs are graphical representations of how configuration objects are connected to each other (e.g., how an application segment is connected to a server group and server groups). They are helpful in determining when and where you might need to fix configuration requisites to get them working together again.
A configuration graph consists of a segment group, application segment, server group, App Connector group, and App Connector. If you find an **Incomplete Configuration** icon (![ZSDK-incompleteicon.png](/downloads/zsdk/application-management/viewing-configuration-graphs/ZSDK-incompleteicon.png)
) next to one of them, you can access the configuration graph by clicking the **Configuration Graph** icon (![Configuration%20Graph.png](/downloads/zsdk/application-management/viewing-configuration-graphs/Configuration%20Graph.png)
) and edit each connected object as required.
Configuration graphs can be accessed from the following pages:
- [App Connector](/zpa/about-connectors)
- [App Connector Groups](/zpa/about-connector-groups)
- [Defined Application Segments](/zpa/about-applications)
- [Segment Groups](/zpa/about-segment-groups)
- [Server Groups](/zpa/about-server-groups)
In the following example, the configuration graph was accessed from the App Connectors page.

Hiding Connections
You can hide connections by clicking the **arrow** icon.

Editing Configuration Objects
You can edit any configuration objects to ensure they meet the configuration requirements.
