To maximize operational efficiency, Zscaler built a highly scalable, global multi-cloud infrastructure for Zscaler SDK for Mobile Apps (ZSDK). An organization is provisioned on one cloud and its traffic is processed by that cloud only.
You might need to whitelist your cloud URL to access ZSDK.
You can find the name of the cloud in the URL that admins use to log in to the Zscaler service.
If an organization logs in to `admin.zsdkone.net`, then that organization's cloud name is `zsdkone.net`.
