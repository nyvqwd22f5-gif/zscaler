ZSDK Private Service Edges are single-tenant instance brokers that provide similar functionality of Public Service Edge in an organization’s environment instead of a Zscaler data center. Your organization hosts them either within your site or on a cloud service, but Zscaler manages them.
Similar to Public Service Edges, Private Service Edges manage the connections from App Connectors. Private Service Edges register with the ZSDK cloud, which allows them to download the relevant policies and configurations in order to enforce all policies.
Private Service Edges provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Implement Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for all of your users.
- Securely access applications when Public Service Edges in data centers are not conveniently located between users and the applications they need to reach.
- Ensure business continuity and continued access to critical services during disaster events.
- Keep application data traffic local to help meet compliance and regulatory requirements.
Private Service Edges can be deployed in different forms. Zscaler distributes images for deployment in enterprise data centers and local private cloud environments (e.g., VMware). Zscaler recommends reading the [Private Service Edge Deployment Prerequisites](/zpa/zpa-service-edge-deployment-prerequisites) prior to [deploying Private Service Edges](/zsdk/deploying-zsdk-private-service-edges).
After you add and deploy a Private Service Edge, it displays on the Private Service Edges page. You can continue performing additional software management and maintenance tasks after deployment.
A user connects to the Private Service Edge to access resources through a public IP address. After a user connects to a Private Service Edge, the user's location is determined by its public IP address, and then a country-based policy for the mapped country is enforced. To learn more, see [About Access Policy](/zsdk/about-access-policy).
If the location of the Private Service Edge group is updated for an existing connection, the Public Service Edge uses the old location until the next time it makes a new connection. Location changes via a GeoIP configuration override are not supported for Private Service Edges.

- **Description**: The description of the Private Service Edge.
- **Private Service Edge Group**: The assigned Private Service Edge group for the Private Service Edge.
- **Private Service Edge Host Platform**: The platform that the Private Service Edge is hosted on (e.g., AWS, ESXi, VMware).
- **Private Service Edge Host OS**: The run-time OS on which the Private Service Edge is running (e.g., CentOS Linux 7).
- **Private Service Edge Package OS**: The compile-time OS on which the `.rpm` binary is packaged (e.g., Enterprise Linux 7).
- **Last Software Update**: The date and time when the Private Service Edge was last updated to a software version.

- **Last Connection to Zscaler**: The last time the Private Service Edge connected to Zscaler.
- **Last Disconnect from Zscaler**: The last time the Private Service Edge disconnected from Zscaler.
- **Location**: The location of the Private Service Edge group that is assigned to the Private Service Edge.
- **Public IP**: The public IP address of the Private Service Edge. If the Private Service Edge was disconnected, the last known public IP address displays.
- **Private IP**: The private IP address of the Private Service Edge. If the Private Service Edge was disconnected, the last known private IP address displays.
- **Uptime**: The time duration when the Private Service Edge is available for use. If the Private Service Edge is disconnected, **Not Available** displays as the value.
- **Enrollment Certificate **The enrollment certificate used for the Private Service Edge.
-
**Supporting Files Upgrade Status**: When enabled, this field indicates the upgrade status and current version of the supporting files used to map the public IP address of the Private Service Edge to the country where the IP address is registered.
The **Information** icon appears next to the supporting file to indicate the supporting file failed to upgrade.
- **Publish IPs or Domains**: The IP addresses and domains that clients and App Connectors can use to open a connection to the Private Service Edge. If these are not specified, then the clients and App Connectors try to connect using the Listen IPs.
- **Listen IPs**: The IP addresses that the Private Service Edge listens for connection requests from clients and App Connectors at set addresses. If this is not configured, then the Private Service Edge listens to all interfaces.
