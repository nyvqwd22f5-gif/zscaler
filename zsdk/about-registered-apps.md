You must register your mobile app to obtain an app key before implementing Zscaler SDK for Mobile Apps. This registration process configures essential security settings for your app.
Registered apps provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Provision and manage unique app keys for each mobile app or environment.
- Configure trust binding levels to match your security requirements.

- **Name**: The name of the registered app key.
- **Authentication Type**: The identity provider for validating access tokens for your app. This is always set to **One Identity**.
- **Trust Binding**: The device's re-enrollment frequency. The value is one of the following:
- **Strong**: Requires more frequent device re-enrollment for heightened security.
- **Loose**: Allows longer intervals between device re-enrollments.
- **Published**: The app key's published state. The values are true or false.
- **Raw Config**: The raw configuration of the app key.
- **App Key**: The assigned app key to the registered app. You can copy the app key to your clipboard for use.
- **Revoked**: The app key's revoked status. The values are true or false.
- Configure your table settings for display.

Select an action for the registered key:
- **Revoke**: Deactivate your app key so that it can no longer be used.
- **Edit**: Edit your unpublished app key prior to use.
- **Publish**: Activate your app key for use.
- **Delete**: Delete your unpublished app key.
After a registered app key is published, you can then revoke the key as an action. The edit, publish, and delete actions are unavailable after a registered app key is published.
