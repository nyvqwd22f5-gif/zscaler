Zscaler recommends the following when you are configuring ZSDK:
- Always use the shared instance of the `ZscalerZSDK` class for consistency across your applications.
- Use `ZscalerConfiguration` prior to starting any tunnels.
- Implement proper error handling using `ZscalerError` for iOS or `ZscalerSDKException` for Android, and their associated error codes. To learn more, see [Developer Reference](/zsdk/developer-reference).
- To manage your app's ZSDK lifecycle:
- Call `suspend()` when the app enters the background for Android or before app suspension for iOS.
- Call `resume()` when the app returns to the foreground.
- Ensure network operations are complete before suspension.
- Subscribe to `ZscalerSDK` notifications to monitor changes in the tunnel state by using platform-specific notification settings (e.g., `BroadcastReceiver` for Android, `NSNotification` for iOS).
- Export and clear logs as needed for debugging and maintenance.
