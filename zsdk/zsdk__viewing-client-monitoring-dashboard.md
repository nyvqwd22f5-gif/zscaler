The Client Monitoring dashboard provides a high-level overview of device usage across your users and their mobile devices. You can use this dashboard to gather device details about locations, operating systems, bandwidth usage, device usage, device models, and hardware manufacturer to gain a deeper understanding of where and when your users are using their mobile devices to access your application. You can also analyze the trend data to determine whether access policies need to be configured more efficiently.
