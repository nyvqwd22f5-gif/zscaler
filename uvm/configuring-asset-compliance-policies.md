Zscaler Asset Exposure Management (AEM) allows organizations to collect and manage asset data from various sources to track and manage asset inventory and coverage. With AEM, you can create policies that ensure asset compliance across your organization's assets.
Two primary benefits include:
- Ensuring your organization's Configuration Management Database (CMDB) contains a comprehensive and accurate inventory of assets.
- Identifying and tracking tool coverage gaps.
Policy rules are designed to generate policy violations on assets that are out of compliance with a given security standard in your organization. Policy violations can then be assigned to a designated owner, tracked against a specific SLA deadline, and prioritized with a severity score. When assigned, these violations can be dispatched to relevant team members for prompt action. Automatically alerting you to policy violations helps organizations operationalize efforts to drive compliance with asset-related policies.
Creating Policies
Creating new policies for tracking asset compliance involves selecting the policy category, defining the asset population that the policy applies to, and setting the policy scenario (i.e., the conditions that generate a policy violation).
For access to Policies, your assigned role must include the Read, Create, Edit permissions under the Assets App > Policy Rule resource. To learn more, see [Creating Custom Roles](/uvm/creating-custom-roles) and [Assigning Roles to Users](/uvm/assigning-roles-users). The Asset Admin can create and manage policies, but can't delete them.
To create a new policy:
- Go to **Assets **> **Policies**.
-
Click **Create**.
[See image.](#create-policies-button)
The **Create New Policy **page appears.
- On the **Create New Policy **page, configure the following sections:
- [Details](#details-section)
- [Policy Criteria](#policy-criteria-section)
- [Formatting Rule](#formatting-rule-section)
- [Trigger Settings](#trigger-settings-section)
- [Policy Violation Findings](#policy-violation-findings-section)
- Click **Preview **to test and adjust the policy configuration. This displays the top 50 policy violations generated by the policy.
After creating and saving a policy, assets that violate the policy automatically generate policy violations, which can be viewed and monitored on the [Policy Violations](/uvm/about-policy-violations-operational-view-aem) page. The policy violations are aggregated into violation tickets that can be tracked on the [Violation Tickets](/uvm/about-violation-tickets-operational-view-aem) page.
You can manage and adjust the policy's settings and criteria in the Policies table. To learn more, see [Managing Asset Compliance Policies](/uvm/managing-asset-compliance-policies).
Save & Run Ruleset
After creating the policy, save the policy to complete the process in one of the following ways:
- Click **Save **to save the policy. The policy will apply the next time data is ingested into your account.
- In the **Save **drop-down menu, click **Save & Run **to save the policy and immediately run it.
[]To set the policy's basic details:
- **Title**: Enter a name that reflects the policy violations it generates.
- **Description**: (Optional) Enter a brief description of the policy violations.
-
**Category**: Select one of the following options:
- **CMDB Hygiene**: Flag assets with incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data in your CMDB. This maintains a reliable, accurate, and comprehensive asset inventory. To learn more, see [Using the CMDB Hygiene Policy](/uvm/using-cmdb-hygiene-policy).
- **Tool Coverage**: Flag assets that lack coverage from a specific tool used in your security stack, such as EDR tools. This ensures your assets are covered by the necessary security tools required by your organization. To learn more, see [Using the Tool Coverage Policy](/uvm/using-tool-coverage-policy).
- **OS End of Life**: Flag assets running operating systems that have reached the end of their supported lifecycle. This mitigates potential security vulnerabilities stemming from outdated OS and strengthens compliance with industry regulations. To learn more, see [Using the OS End of Life Policy](/uvm/using-os-end-life-policy).
- **Custom**: Create a custom policy tailored to your organization's specific needs. For example, detect and manage assets with outdated tool coverage or assets with conflicting values in key fields, and optionally restrict access until the issue is resolved.
The selected category modifies the available configuration options in the **Policy Criteria **settings.
-
**Severity**: Set a severity score for the policy violations (this adjusts the severity category accordingly). The severity is reflected in the policy violations, and consequently in the reports and dashboards within your AEM application.
The severity indicates the level of risk or impact associated with noncompliant assets identified by the policy, and provides a baseline for efficient prioritization of exposure.

[]In the **Policy Criteria **section, define the asset population for the policy, and then set the conditions that constitute a violation of the policy.
This step defines the Policy Scenario for the relevant Asset Population:
- **Asset Population**: A group of assets that the policy applies to (e.g., Workstations, Cloud Resources). Assets not included in the population criteria are not evaluated for violations.
-
**Policy Scenario**: The set of conditions that constitute a policy violation (e.g., the asset is running an outdated software version, or missing an asset owner).
[See image.](#policy-criteria-cmdb-hygiene-example)
To set the policy criteria:
- Under **Asset Population**, set the conditions to filter the assets that the policy applies to:
- Select a field that the condition should be based on.
- Select an operator (e.g., **Equals**, **Contains**). Available operators vary depending on the field type, indicated to the left of the field name.
- Enter the value that the rule should apply to.
- (Optional) Use **AND**/**OR **logic to define compound rules:
- **AND **includes assets only if they meet all conditions in the rule.
- **OR **includes assets if they meet any of the conditions in the rule.
- Under **Policy Scenario**, set the conditions that constitute a violation of the policy based on the policy category selected in the **Details **section.
- To configure policy scenarios for system policies using predefined templates (i.e., the Simple setup), see the available system policies:
- [CMDB Hygiene](/uvm/using-cmdb-hygiene-policy)
- [Tool Coverage](/uvm/using-tool-coverage-policy)
- [OS End-of-Life](/uvm/using-os-end-life-policy)
- To configure policy scenarios for custom policies, or to configure advanced conditions for system policies:
- Select the source of the value being evaluated (i.e., **Original Source Value **or** Merged Entity Value**). To learn more, see [Understanding Original Source and Merged Entity Values](/uvm/understanding-original-source-and-merged-entity-values).
- Set the conditions for the policy scenario:
- Select a field that the condition should be based on.
- Select an operator (e.g., **Equals**, **Contains**). Available operators vary depending on the field type, indicated to the left of the field name.
- Enter the value that the rule should apply to.
- (Optional) Use **AND**/**OR **logic to define compound rules:
- **AND **applies only if all conditions are met.
- **OR **applies if any of the conditions are met.
[]![aem policy criteria](/downloads/uvm/asset-exposure-management-aem/settings-aem/configuring-asset-compliance-policies/aem%20policy%20criteria.png)
[]In the **Formatting Rule **section, set a benchmark formatting rule to display your policy's compliance levels using percentage thresholds. This helps you easily identify and report compliance rates. You can either select an existing formatting rule that applies to the current policy, or create a new rule for the policy. To learn more, see [Creating Formatting Rules](/uvm/creating-formatting-rules).
To create a new formatting rule for the policy:
-
Click **New Rule**.
The **Create Formatting Rule **drawer appears.
-
In the **Create Formatting Rule **drawer:
- **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., `Policy Compliance Threshold`).
- Define the conditions:
- Select an operator (e.g., **>**, **<**, **=**, **Between**). If you select **Between**, set both start and end values for the range.
- Enter a value for the condition.
-
Assign a color for the condition (e.g., red for <25%).
Green typically represents satisfactory rates, and red represents unsatisfactory rates.
- **Fallback Formatting Rule Logic**: Assign a default color to display when no other condition applies to a value.
- Click **Done**.

[]In the **Trigger Settings **section, set the frequency and time that the policy is run.
To set the trigger settings:
- In the **Frequency** drop-down menu, select a trigger option:
- **Daily**: Triggers a policy run at a specified time every day.
- **Weekly**: Triggers a policy run on a specific day of the week at a specified time.
- **Monthly**: Triggers a policy run on a specific day of the month at a specified time.
- **Custom**: Triggers a policy run at a specified interval (e.g., every x hours).
- Select the time or day as necessary.

[]![Policy trigger settings.](/downloads/uvm/asset-exposure-management-aem/settings-aem/configuring-asset-compliance-policies/policy%20trigger%20settings.png)
[]In the **Policy Violation Findings **section, set the title and description of the policy violations.
-
Click the **Title** box.
An editor window appears.
-
Select a method for populating the title and the description fields:
- **Smart Text**: Use free text, or create a template using a combination of free text and field values. To insert field values into the text, enclose the field name in double curly brackets (e.g., `{{Asset Name}}`). The field's display name automatically translates to its system name (e.g., Asset Name → `asset.name`).
- **Value**: Enter a fixed value for the policy violation title or the policy violation description. This option is static text that is used for all policy violations generated by the policy. A fixed value is useful if you have a standard title or description that applies to all violations of the policy.
- **Field**: Select a field to dynamically populate the policy violation title or policy violation description with a value from a specific field. For example, select the **Asset Name **field to insert the name of the affected asset in the policy violation title or description.
[See image.](#policy-title-description-text-editor)
- Repeat this procedure for the **Description** box.
