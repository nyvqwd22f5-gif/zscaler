PDF: https://help.zscaler.com/pdf/com/en/1528026.pdf

The ServiceNow outegration is used to dispatch tickets from the Zscaler Security Operations (SecOps) platform applications (e.g., UVM) to your ServiceNow tables, creating a ServiceNow ticket that can then be tracked, assigned, and managed by your remediation teams working with ServiceNow.
This article is a step-by-step guide to setting up the ServiceNow work management outegration. The process involves setting up authentication, outegration visibility in the platform, outegration mapping, and when relevant, configuring a ServiceNow webhook to enable bidirectional synchronization.
Each ServiceNow Table Type (e.g., Remediation Task, Incident) requires a separate outegration configuration.
Prerequisites
Retrieve the required authentication parameters based on your selected authentication method (e.g., Username and Password, OAuth 2.0), and enter them in the corresponding fields during the Connect step of the outegration setup wizard.
- [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-2)
- [User Name Password Client Id Client Secret](#username-pw-clientID-client-secret)
- [Basic Authentication (Username and Password)](#basic-auth)
- [Jwt OAuth2](#Jwt-OAuth2)
Creating the ServiceNow Outegration
To configure the ServiceNow outegration, complete the following steps:
- [Step 1: Authenticate the ServiceNow Connection (Connect)](#step1-snow-authentication)
- [Step 2: Configure the Outegration Visibility and Behavior (Settings)](#step2-snow-settings)
- [Step 3: Map the Outegration Fields (Mapping)](#step3-snow-mapping)
- [(Optional) Step 4: Configure the ServiceNow Webhook](#step4-snow-webhook)
[]Obtain the following required parameters for the OAuth 2.0 authentication:
- [Instance Name](#oauth-instance-name)
- [Client ID and Client Secret](#oauth-client-ID-client-Secret)
- [Refresh Token and Access Token](#refresh-access-token)
[]The ServiceNow instance name is the name of the hosted ServiceNow instance found in the URL in the format `https://``<Instance Name>``.service-now.com`. For example, if your URL is `https://``acme``.service-now.com/`, then the instance name is `acme`.
[]For the OAuth 2.0 authentication method, you'll need to provide ServiceNow client credentials that were generated using a ServiceNow admin account.
To create a client ID and client secret:
- Log in to ServiceNow as an admin user.
- In the relevant instance, go to **System OAuth **> **Application Registry**.
- Click **New**.
-
On the interceptor page, click **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.
The **Application Registries** window appears.
-
In the **Application Registries** window:
- **Name**: Enter a name that identifies the platform.
- **Client ID**:** **Automatically generated by the instance.
- **Client Secret**:** **Automatically generated by the instance after you submit the form.
- **Refresh Token Lifespan**: Enter** **8,640,000 seconds (100 days) and can be increased.
- **Access Token Lifespan**: Enter** **1,800 seconds (30 Minutes). This can be increased.
[See image.](#snow-creds-form1)
- Click **Submit**.
[]Generating the refresh token for your ServiceNow outegration involves making a curl request to the ServiceNow OAuth token endpoint. To make the curl request, insert the following OAuth 2.0 credentials into the command:
- `<Instance Name>`: Enter the instance name previously retrieved (e.g., `acme`).
- `grant_type`: Set to `password`.
- `<Client ID>`: The client ID of your OAuth application previously generated.
- `<Client Secret>`: The client secret of your OAuth application previously generated.
- `<Username>`: Your ServiceNow user account name that authorizes the access token request.
- `<Password>`: The password for the ServiceNow user account that authorizes the access token request.
To generate the refresh token, launch your terminal or an API platform (e.g., Postman) and run the following command:
`curl --location 'https://<Instance Name>.service-now.com/oauth_token.do' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=<Client ID>' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<Client Secret>' \
--data-urlencode 'username=<Username>' \
--data-urlencode 'password=<Password>'`
The curl request returns an access token and a refresh token. Make sure to enter the refresh token in the mandatory Refresh Token field in the outegration authentication. The access token is optional, and is automatically generated if left blank.

- [Instance Name](#jwt-instance-name)
- [Client ID and Client Secret](#jwt-clientID-client-secret)
- [Key ID](#jwt-keyID)
- [Subject](#jwt-subject)
To learn more, refer to the [ServiceNow documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-platform-security/page/administer/security/task/create-jwt-endpoint.html).
[]The ServiceNow instance name is the name of the hosted ServiceNow instance found in the URL in the format `https://``<Instance Name>``.service-now.com`. For example, if your URL is `https://``acme``.service-now.com/`, then the instance name is `acme`.
[]For the Jwt OAuth2 authentication method, you'll need to provide ServiceNow client credentials that were generated using a ServiceNow admin account.
To create client ID and client secret:
- Log in to ServiceNow with an admin user.
- In the relevant instance, go to **System OAuth **> **Application Registry**.

- Click **Submit**.
[]![creating the snow jwt oauth2 client credentials form](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/configuring-servicenow-outegration/snow%20jwt%20oauth2%20client%20creds%20form.png)
[]For the JWT auth method, you'll need to provide a Key ID (or KID), which is generated when creating a new verifier map.
[See image.](#snow-jwt-key-id-example)
[]![snow jwt key id](/downloads/uvm/administration/connectors/outegrations/outegration-configuration-guides/configuring-servicenow-outegration/snow%20jwt%20key%20id.png)
[]The Jwt OAuth2 authentication method requires the subject (`sub`) field for authenticating with ServiceNow. This value is used to identify the user in the `sys_user` table. If the User field in the JWT authentication profile is left as the default (i.e., email), the Subject must match the user's email address. If the User field was changed (e.g., to `user_name`), the Subject must instead match the value in that specified field.
[]The first step in setting up your ServiceNow outegration is to authenticate using valid credentials to establish a secure connection with your ServiceNow instance. With the required parameters retrieved in the prerequisites, you can begin the ServiceNow outegration setup in the SecOps platform.
To create an outegration:
-
In the SecOps platform, go to **Configure** > **Outegrations**.
[See image.](#configure-outegrations)
-
Click **Create**, then select **ServiceNow**.
The **Connect** step appears.
[See image.](#snow-outegration-connect)
- In the **Details** section:
- **Display Name**: Enter a name for your outegration.
- **Active**: Enable to activate the ServiceNow outegration.
- **Instance Name**: Enter the name of the hosted ServiceNow instance where the tickets should be created.
- **Authentication**: Select an existing authentication, or click **Create New** to set up a new authentication, and enter the required parameters you retrieved earlier into the corresponding fields. To learn more, see [Configuring Authentications](/uvm/configuring-authentications).
- Click **Test** in the bottom-right corner of the screen to verify the connection. Invalid credentials trigger error messages to assist with troubleshooting connectivity issues.
- After the test passes, click **Next **to advance to the **Settings **step.
Adding a Certificate in Jwt OAuth2
When authenticating using the Jwt OAuth2 method, a dialog window appears containing a certificate after entering the parameters and successfully creating the authentication.
[See image.](#jwt-oauth-certificate)
To complete the authentication process:
- Copy the certificate from the window.
- In the ServiceNow portal, go to **System Definition **> **Certificates**.
- Click **New**.
- Fill in the entry details, and paste the certificate in the **PEM Certificate **field.
- Click **Submit**.
- Link the certificate in the **Application Registry **by updating the **Verifier Map **field to reference the new entry in `Sys_certificate`.
- Click **Test **in the bottom-right corner of the page to verify the connection. Invalid credentials trigger error messages to assist with troubleshooting connectivity issues.
- After the test passes, click **Next **to advance to the **Settings **step.

[]![jwt oauth 2 certificate](/downloads/uvm/administration/connectors/outegrations/outegration-configuration-guides/configuring-servicenow-outegration/jwt.png)
[]In the Settings step of the outegration setup wizard, configure your ServiceNow outegration's visibility and behavior within the relevant application in the SecOps platform (e.g., UVM, AEM). In this step, you'll set the SecOps entity that triggers the ServiceNow ticket dispatch (e.g., ticket, violation ticket), the ServiceNow table that the SecOps ticket should be dispatched to, and when the Create ServiceNow Ticket button should appear in the application. The Create ServiceNow Ticket button allows end users with access to SecOps tickets to dispatch these tickets to a ServiceNow table directly from the SecOps ticket drawer or from the SecOps tickets page.
To configure the outegration's visibility and behavior:
- In the **Advanced Settings** section:
-
**Create ServiceNow item from**:** **Select the entity that you want to configure the outegration for. This selection affects the view you'll configure in the <Entity> **View **step (e.g., selecting Ticket displays the Tickets View setting).
- **UVM**: Select **Ticket**.
- **AEM**: Select **Violation Ticket**.
Other entity types might be visible depending on the apps enabled in your account.
[See image.](#create-snow-item-field)
-
**Table**:** **Select the ServiceNow table that the SecOps ticket should be dispatched to. The schema associated with the selected table will be retrieved from your ServiceNow table and made available for mapping in the Mapping step.
[See image.](#snow-table-type-field)
-
In the <Entity> **View** section, select how the SecOps ticket should display the **Create ServiceNow Ticket **button. This setting can be modified at any time.
- **Always**: Select to display the button in all tickets, allowing users to dispatch tickets to a ServiceNow ticket without exception.
- **Never**: Select to hide the button in all tickets. This is useful during the outegration* *setup process to hide the button from users while still keeping the outegration active.
- **For specific tickets**: Define custom conditions to control when the button is displayed, allowing you to target specific tickets. For example, if your organization uses multiple ticketing systems, you can grant access to the button only to users who work with ServiceNow, while excluding those who use other ticketing systems (e.g., Jira).
[See image.](#snow-tickets-view-setting)
- Click **Map **to advance to the **Mapping** step.
The **Create ServiceNow Ticket **button appears in two locations:
-
In the individual entity drawer (e.g., in the [UVM ticket drawer](/uvm/managing-tickets-uvm), in the [AEM violation ticket drawer](/uvm/managing-violation-tickets-aem)).
[See image.](#snow-button-in-ticket)
-
On the entity page in the relevant application (e.g., on the [Tickets page](/uvm/about-tickets-operational-view-uvm) in UVM, on the [Violation Tickets page](/uvm/about-violation-tickets-operational-view-aem) in AEM).

[]The third step in setting up your ServiceNow outegration is configuring the field mapping between your SecOps tickets and ServiceNow tickets. This defines how data is exchanged and synchronized between the two systems upon initial dispatch and subsequent updates. The SecOps platform's unique mapping capabilities allow for flexible mapping of any custom field or logic to any field in your ServiceNow tables, facilitating highly customized workflows that align with your organization's requirements.
The main objective of the mapping process is to map values to fields. To map values to fields, configure values on the left to populate the fields selected on the right.
[See image.](#snow-mapping-right-left)
There are three mapping components:
- Tickets initially dispatched to ServiceNow: Map SecOps ticket fields (left) to ServiceNow fields (right) for the initial dispatch of a ticket to a ServiceNow ticket. You can also add an attachment to your ServiceNow ticket. Commonly mapped fields include Short Description, Description, Assignment Group, Priority, Due Date, and Status.
- (Optional) Sync from ticket to ServiceNow: Map SecOps ticket fields (left) to ServiceNow fields (right) for syncing ticket updates to ServiceNow, including configuring comments and adding an attachment to your ServiceNow ticket. Commonly mapped fields include Status and Due Date.
- (Optional) Sync from ServiceNow to ticket: Map ServiceNow fields (left) to SecOps ticket fields (right) for syncing ServiceNow updates to SecOps tickets. This step also requires setting up a ServiceNow webhook. Commonly mapped fields include Ticket Status and Ticket SLA.
The initial ServiceNow outegration mapping includes preconfigured default mappings for each part, based on common use cases and industry best practices. These defaults can be modified and customized as needed.
Creating a New Mapping
In each of the three mapping components, you'll need to select a field on the right, and then configure the corresponding field value on the left.
To create a new mapping:
- Select a field (right):
- Click** Mapping**.
-
Select a field on the right.
The field's schema details open on the right of the page. The schema lists available ServiceNow fields to be used during mapping. This is the list of fields configured in your ServiceNow table for the Table selected in the [Settings](#step2-jira-settings) step (e.g., Task).
[See image.](#state-schema-fields)
The following details are specified for fields, when available:
- [Required](#snow-schema-required)
- [Input Type](#snow-schema-input-type)
- [Available Options](#snow-schema-available-options)
- Configure the field value (left):
-
Click **Add value** on the left.
The **Field Editor** appears.
- In the **Field Editor**, select one of the following methods to configure the value of the field:
- [Field (Dictionary)](#snow-field-dictionary)
- [Smart Text](#snow-smart-text)
- [Script](#snow-script-python)
Repeat** **the mapping process for all required ServiceNow fields and for any other fields you want to map.
In addition to the mapping of fields on the right to fields on the left, you can perform a set of actions when setting up the ServiceNow outegration mapping, each relevant to a specific part of the mapping.
- [Set a ticket field as mandatory.](#snow-set-as-mandatory)
- [Add attachments to the ticket dispatch.](#snow-attachments)
- [Configure comments synchronization.](#snow-comments)
Mapping Ticket Title to Short Description
To illustrate the mapping process, consider the mapping of the required ServiceNow Short Description field. The final result of the mapping process should show the Short Description field on the right, and the Ticket Title field on the left.
![e043fe38-8be5-491d-a8cf-c689b1cb3fa6.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/e043fe38-8be5-491d-a8cf-c689b1cb3fa6.png)
To map the Ticket Title field to the Short Description field:
-
Select **Short Description **as the ServiceNow field on the right.
[See image.](#example-snow-short-description-right)
Selecting the ServiceNow Short Description field opens the field's details in the schema. The schema specifies that the field is required and thus must be mapped before the outegration can be saved, and that the field expects a TEXT input type. Therefore, the field for which a value is being configured must also be of TEXT type.
[See image.](#example-short-description-schema)
-
Select the **Ticket Title **field on the left:
- Click** Add Value**.
- Under the **Field** tab, select the **Ticket Title** field, which is the equivalent to the ServiceNow **Short Description **field.
[See image.](#example-ticket-title-field)
Previewing the Ticket to ServiceNow Mapping
After completing the SecOps ticket to ServiceNow dispatch mapping, preview the mapping to review the configuration. This helps ensure that SecOps ticket dispatch is behaving as expected and that the ServiceNow ticket fields are populated correctly.
To preview the mapping, click **Preview **on the bottom right of the ticket initially dispatched to ServiceNow section. The Mapping Preview window appears. On the left of the Mapping Preview window, there is a sample of the SecOps tickets in your account, organized by ticket ID. You can select, filter, or search tickets and preview the mapping to their corresponding ServiceNow ticket. You can also open the actual SecOps ticket in a new tab for a more in-depth review.
[See image.](#snow-preview)
Common Mapping Examples
These mapping examples highlight commonly used field configurations in your outegration. While some might be preconfigured by default, Zscaler recommends reviewing and customizing them to ensure they align with your workflow.
- [Ticket to ServiceNow Description](#mapping-ticket-snow-description)
- [Ticket SLA to ServiceNow Due Date Sync](#mapping-snow-due-date-ticket-sla)
[]![snow outegration mapping right left](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/configuring-servicenow-outegration/snow%20outegration%20mapping%20right%20left.png)
[]![6334eca4-ef35-4f2e-af6e-addd91a1d1d0.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/6334eca4-ef35-4f2e-af6e-addd91a1d1d0.png)
[]The Required attribute is TRUE if a field is required by ServiceNow. If a field is not required, the attribute is not displayed. A required ServiceNow field is also indicated by a red asterisk (*) on the ServiceNow field in the first mapping step.
Required ServiceNow fields must be mapped before saving the outegration.
[]The Input Type specifies the data type of the ServiceNow field, such as TEXT (e.g., Short Description), DATE (e.g., Due Date), or NUMBER (e.g., Reassignment Count). This indicates the format that the selected source field must match in order to successfully map to the ServiceNow field.
[]For ServiceNow fields with fixed values, the Available Options column displays the available values. For example, if the ServiceNow field Priority is configured to include the following fixed values—5 - Planning, 1 - Critical, 2 - High, -- None --, 3 - Moderate, and 4 - Low—the corresponding values in the Ticket Severity field can be mapped to these values.
[]![d7aa3f04-aaeb-4952-a90c-c9071d586549.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/d7aa3f04-aaeb-4952-a90c-c9071d586549.png)

[]Select a field on the left to populate the field on the right.
Dictionary
The field dictionary allows you to create mappings between specific values from the field on the right and values of the field on the left. To use the dictionary, you must first select a field on the right and then a field to populate it with on the left.
For example, if your ServiceNow** **Priority field includes the following fixed values—1 - Critical, 2 - High, 3 - Moderate, 4 - Low, None—you can use the dictionary to map the corresponding Ticket Severity values to each of the Priority field values.
[See image.](#snow-example-dictionary)
[]![4e7da971-188b-4125-9d2a-ba677b76ad49.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/4e7da971-188b-4125-9d2a-ba677b76ad49.png)
[]Configure the field value using free text, or create a template using a combination of free text and selected fields. This allows you to dynamically insert specific field values (e.g., Ticket SLA, Ticket Assignee, or Asset Name) into customized free text sentences or paragraphs.
To add a Smart Text field, enclose it in double curly brackets (e.g., `{{Ticket Assignee}}`.) The field's display name automatically translates to its system name.
This option is commonly used to configure the value of fields like Ticket Title and Ticket Description.
[See image.](#snow-example-smart-text)
[]![8fbef3fd-16c1-4765-9d86-8feb22e3ec45.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/8fbef3fd-16c1-4765-9d86-8feb22e3ec45.png)
[]For use cases that require more advanced configuration than either of the two methods above, you can use Python scripts to configure the source field value to be mapped to the target field.
[]![a87e249c-1d17-40b9-bee3-e53bb15a79b2.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/a87e249c-1d17-40b9-bee3-e53bb15a79b2.png)
[]When dispatching tickets to ServiceNow, map the ServiceNow Description field with a summary of the Ticket content to provide remediation teams with a brief overview of the ticket.
To configure the Ticket to ServiceNow Description mapping:
- Click** Mapping**.
- Select** Description** as the field on the right.
-
Click **Add Value** on the left.
The **Field Editor** appears.
- In the **Field Editor**, select **Smart Text**.
- Enter a ticket description, including dynamic fields (e.g., `{{SLA}}`).
Tickets dispatched to ServiceNow will now include the configured description.
[]In the Ticket to ServiceNow sync, map the ServiceNow Due Date field to keep timelines in sync with Ticket SLA changes.
To configure the Ticket SLA to ServiceNow Due Date mapping:
- Click** Mapping**.
- Select** Due Date** as the field on the right.
-
Click** Add Value** on the left.
The **Field Editor** appears.
- In the **Field Editor**, select **Field**, and select **Ticket SLA** as the field on the left.
Ticket SLA changes will now automatically update ServiceNow ticket due dates.
[]![1ebbf86c-8745-4e72-9fea-8fbb59e2fe6f.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/1ebbf86c-8745-4e72-9fea-8fbb59e2fe6f.png)
[]You can set a SecOps ticket field as mandatory, by selecting the Set as Mandatory** **checkbox in the Column Menu to the right of the mapping. Some fields can be set as mandatory by default.
[See image.](#snow-set-as-mandatory-checkbox)
Setting a field as mandatory guarantees that critical fields (e.g., Ticket Assignee) are always populated before a ticket is dispatched to ServiceNow, so ServiceNow tickets are always actionable for your remediation teams. Attempts to dispatch a ticket without a value in a mandatory field will trigger an error message.
Required fields are defined by your ServiceNow schema, whereas Mandatory fields are mandatory for SecOps ticket dispatch.
[]![mceclip0.png](/downloads/uvm/configure/outegrations/servicenow-outegration/mceclip0.png)
[]You can create a file attachment that summarizes your ticket content and set the trigger to automatically add it to your ServiceNow ticket. Adding an attachment to your ServiceNow ticket simplifies the review and management of findings dispatched from a ticket.
You can configure file attachments in two of the mapping steps:
-
Initial ticket dispatch
[See image.](#snow-attachment-intial-dispatch)
-
Sync from Ticket to ServiceNow
[See image.](#attachment-ticket-snow-sync)
When configured in the Ticket to ServiceNow sync section, the attachment is included in the ServiceNow ticket alongside existing attachments as a downloadable file in the selected format.
Use the **File Format** drop-down menu on the top left of the attachment page to select from the available formats (**CSV**, **PDF**, **JSONL**, **Excel**).
[See image.](#snow-attachment-format)
To provide your ServiceNow remediation teams with a comprehensive view of the findings in the ticket, consider including the following fields in your attachment:

[]In the Ticket to ServiceNow sync step, you can configure how ticket comments are synchronized with ServiceNow ticket comments. To configure comments, click **Comment Sync**.
[See image.](#snow-comments-sync-button)
Sync Comments
Enable **Sync Comments **to automatically push comments from the ticket's Comments tab to the corresponding ServiceNow ticket.
[See image.](#snow-sync-comments-toggle)
Trigger Comments
Enable **Sync Trigger Comments **and set conditions to trigger a comment when specific fields are modified. Syncing trigger comments is useful when you want to be notified of important changes to tickets without updating the corresponding ServiceNow ticket. For example, you can configure a trigger to post a comment in ServiceNow when the Ticket Severity changes from Medium to Critical.
[See image.](#snow-sync-trigger-comments-toggle)
To add a trigger condition:
- Select the field you want to monitor (e.g., **Severity**).
- Set the value change that should trigger the comment:
- **From**: Select the original value.
- **To**: Select the updated value.
When the specified change occurs in the ticket, a comment is automatically created and added to the ServiceNow ticket. The following is an example of a trigger comment:
`Linked UVM ticket updated:
Ticket severity changed from: MEDIUM to: CRITICAL
<URL to ticket>`

[]The ServiceNow outegration webhook enables automatic syncing of ServiceNow ticket updates (e.g., Status or SLA changes) to their corresponding SecOps tickets, reducing the need for manual changes. This step is required when configuring the ServiceNow to SecOps ticket mapping to keep the tickets in the two systems in sync. To learn more, see [Configuring the ServiceNow Outgeration Webhook](/uvm/configuring-servicenow-outegration-webhook).
A ServiceNow webhook is only needed to sync updates from ServiceNow to the ticket. It is not required for the initial ticket dispatch or for syncing updates from the ticket to ServiceNow.
When the outegration setup is complete, you can begin dispatching SecOps tickets using the Create ServiceNow Ticket button that appears in the Create Ticket menu within individual tickets, as well as in the Create Issue menu in the Tickets View. To learn more, see [Creating & Managing Third Party Tickets](/uvm/creating-managing-third-party-tickets).
