You can customize the displayed columns and their sorting settings in tables throughout the platform. This article explains how to add and remove the displayed columns, which include measurements (quantitative fields) and dimensions (categorical fields). The Tickets page in the Vulnerabilities app is shown as an example.
To view the available fields that can be displayed as columns, click the **Settings** icon at the top right of the table. The **Manage Table Columns** window appears, displaying columns currently in use on the right, and columns that can be added on the left.
