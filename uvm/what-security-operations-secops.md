Zscaler Security Operations (SecOps) is a unified approach to security that integrates proactive and reactive measures to enhance an organization's overall security posture. It focuses on bridging the gap between traditional exposure management and threat management, creating a cohesive strategy for identifying, prioritizing, and responding to cyber risks. This comprehensive view helps accelerate incident response, improve operational efficiency, and simplify compliance efforts.
Key Features and Benefits
Zscaler SecOps provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Integrate Zscaler SecOps and third-party data for rich context, providing a comprehensive view of your security landscape.
- Offer automated workflows for remediation and updates.
- Provide real-time visibility into security posture and metrics.
There are two applications in the Zscaler SecOps platform:
- Asset Exposure Management (AEM) enables organizations to collect and manage asset data from various sources to track asset inventory and coverage. It allows organizations to understand their attack surface, create policies, and track and remediate policy violations to reduce overall risk.
- Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) provides a single platform for managing vulnerabilities, simplifying the process of identifying and remediating security risks.
How Does Zscaler SecOps Work?
Zscaler SecOps operates on a robust data fabric for security that centralizes and transforms disparate security data. Supported by machine learning and AI, the fabric harmonizes, deduplicates, correlates, and enriches information from various sources, including Zscaler telemetry and third-party tools. The clean, contextualized data leads to more accurate and informative security outcomes. These insights power exposure management solutions, such as AEM and UVM, enabling organizations to understand and address asset risk, prioritize vulnerabilities, and effectively quantify overall cyber risk.
