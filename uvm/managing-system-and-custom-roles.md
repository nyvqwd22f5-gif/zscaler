You can manage and monitor roles from the Roles page, where you'll find a centralized view of all configured system roles and custom roles in your account. To learn more, see [Understanding System Roles](/uvm/understanding-system-roles) and [Creating Custom Roles](/uvm/creating-custom-roles). To assign roles to users, see [Assigning Roles to Users](/uvm/assigning-roles-users).

[]You can edit users assigned a role to add or remove access permissions defined by the role. To learn more, see [Assigning Roles to Users](/uvm/assigning-roles-users).
