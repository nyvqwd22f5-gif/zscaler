Content permissions control access to data within the platform. To create content permission sets, see [Creating & Managing Content Permissions](/uvm/creating-managing-content-permissions). After [creating users](/uvm/creating-managing-users) in your account, you can assign content permissions to define the data they can access.
Content permissions can only be assigned after a user is created and saved.
Assigning Content Permissions to Users
To assign content permission sets to a single user:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Go to **Account Settings **> **User Management**.
-
Hover over the user, and click the **Edit** icon.
The **Edit User** page appears.
- In the **Content Permissions** section, select the role permission sets you want to assign from the drop-down menu. To learn more, see [Creating & Managing Content Permissions](/uvm/creating-managing-content-permissions).

Click **Save**.
Assigned permission sets are applied on the user's next browser refresh.

-
Hover over the user and click the **Edit** icon.
The **Edit User** page appears.
- In the **Content Permissions** section, select the role permission sets you want to remove from the drop-down menu.
-
Click **Save**.
Assigned permission sets are applied on the user's next browser refresh.
To remove multiple users' content permissions:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Go to **Account Settings **> **User Management**.
