User roles control access to features and actions within the platform. After [creating users](/uvm/creating-managing-users) in your account, you can assign roles to define their access and permissions within the system.
You can assign either system roles or custom roles:
- System roles are predefined by the platform and cannot be modified. These roles are maintained by the system and are updated automatically when new features are introduced. To learn more, see [Understanding System Roles](/uvm/understanding-system-roles).
- Custom roles are created and managed by the account admin. These are roles configured specifically in your account to meet organizational requirements. When new system features are introduced, related permissions must be added to custom roles manually. To learn more, see [Creating Custom Roles](/uvm/creating-managing-custom-roles).
When managing roles, you can perform the following actions:
- [Assign Roles to Users](#assign-role)
- [Edit Roles](#edit-role)
- [Remove Roles](#remove-role)
[]You can assign a role to users to grant them specific permissions and access within the system.
To assign a role to users:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Select **Account Settings**.
- On the left-hand navigation, go to **Permissions **> **Roles**.
-
Hover over the role and click the **Edit Users** icon (![88d5cbc5-d08e-40cf-8b1c-a59e3b0614e0.png](/downloads/uvm/account-management/user-management/role-permissions/88d5cbc5-d08e-40cf-8b1c-a59e3b0614e0.png)
).
The **Edit Role** page appears with a list of all users that are assigned the role.
-
On the **Edit Role** page, click **Add** **Users**.
The **Add Users** window appears.
- In the **Add Users** window, select the users you want to assign the role to, then click **Add**.
-
Click **Save**.
Assigned roles are applied on the user's next browser refresh.
[]You can edit a user's role to update their permissions and access, either individually or for multiple users at once.
To edit a single user's role:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Go to **Account Settings **> **User Management**.
- Click the user whose role you want to update.
- In the **Roles** section, select the role you want to assign from the drop-down menu.
- Click **Save**.
To edit multiple users' roles:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Go to **Account Settings **> **User Management**.
- Select the users from the list.
- Click **Edit Role** at the top of the page.
- Select the role you want to assign to the selected users. Selecting the role automatically assigns it to the selected users.
Assigned roles are applied on the user's next browser refresh.
[]You can remove a user from a role to revoke their associated permissions while maintaining their access to the system.
To remove a user from the role:
- Click the **Profile** menu on the top right of the page.
- Go to **Account Settings **> **User Management**.
- Select the user and then click **Remove** **From** **Role**.
- Click **Save**.
When removing a user's role without assigning them a new role, the user is automatically assigned the default role. While the default role grants no permissions within the account, it preserves the user's access to the system, enabling the option to assign a new role in the future.
