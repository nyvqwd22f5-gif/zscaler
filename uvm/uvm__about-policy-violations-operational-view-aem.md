The Policy Violations page provides a centralized overview of all policy violations within your organization's AEM app. Each policy violation represents a deviation from established security policies detected on an asset and aggregated with additional contextual information such as severity, violation origins, and affected asset types. On this page, you can explore policy violation details, analyze their impact, prioritize remediation actions, and streamline workflows using risk-driven insights.
The Policy Violations page provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Access and organize policy violations using system-saved views, filters, grouping options, and customizable table columns to focus on specific scenarios or issues.
- Dive into detailed information about each policy violation to prioritize actions effectively.
- Dispatch policy violations to external platforms (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow) to streamline workflows and remediation processes.
