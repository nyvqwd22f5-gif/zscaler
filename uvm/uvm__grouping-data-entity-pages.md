You can use the grouping feature to organize the data on pages (e.g., Tickets, Assets, Findings for UVM; Assets, Violation Tickets, Violation Findings for AEM). Grouping your view creates collapsible sections based on the field you select. For example, grouping the UVM Tickets view by Ticket Severity categorizes the tickets into the different severity values (i.e., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info).
To add grouping to a page:
- Go to the SecOps app's entity page (e.g., [Tickets](/uvm/about-tickets-operational-view-uvm) or [Findings](/uvm/about-findings-operational-view-uvm) in UVM, [Violation Tickets](/uvm/about-violation-tickets-operational-view-aem) or [Policy Violations](/uvm/about-policy-violations-operational-view-aem) in AEM).
-
Click the **Group By **drop-down menu.

- Select the field you want to group the view by (e.g., **Assignee Tags**, **Assignee ID**, etc.).
The view is updated by your selected grouping. To remove the grouping, click **Clear Selection **at the bottom of the **Group By **drop-down menu.

Your grouping preferences can be saved as a set view. To learn more, see [Creating & Managing Saved Views](/uvm/creating-managing-saved-views).
