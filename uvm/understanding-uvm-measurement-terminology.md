This article describes built-in measurements used in the Zscaler Security Operations (SecOps) platform's dashboards and reports. These measurements depend on the states and statuses of tickets. To learn more, see [About Tickets](/uvm/about-tickets).
Additional measurements can be added upon request, and default measurements' calculations can be overridden according to specific needs. Contact your Zscaler Account team for more details.
Status Buckets
A ticket's status indicates its current stage in the workflow at any given time. Ticket statuses are arranged in buckets, which ensures that the ticket workflow remains logical and coherent. You can add a new status under a bucket, allowing you to add a descriptive label to a ticket. You can change the name of a status and status bucket.
To access the Ticket Statuses page:
- In the SecOps platform, go to **Vulnerabilities **> **Settings **> **Ticket Lifecycle**.
The **Ticket Lifecycle** page appears.
- Click **Ticket Statuses**.

- To add a new bucket, click **Add Bucket.**
- To add a new status, click **Add Status **under a bucket.
- Click **Done **to exit the page.
Ticket States
Tickets can have the following states:
- **Active**: The ticket has at least one active finding.
- **Inactive**: All findings under the ticket are undetected. The ticket is waiting to be confirmed as closed.
- **Archived**: A ticket no longer contains any findings (e.g., due to a change in grouping settings or the merging of tickets).
Ticket Measurements
The following table shows information about ticket measurements:
| **Name** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------------- |
| New Tickets | The number of tickets created in the set date range. |
| Total Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive that are not in the Closed bucket. |
| Opened Tickets | The number of tickets that were set for the Open bucket during the set date range.This includes new tickets that were set to a status from the Open bucket and tickets that were reopened in the set date range. |
| Active Tickets (Open) | The number of tickets set as Active that are not in the Closed bucket.This measurement does not include inactive tickets. |
| Total Active Tickets | The number of tickets set as active, no matter their status. |
| Total Tickets Over SLA | The number of tickets that went over their service level agreement (SLA) date.For tickets not in the Closed bucket, over SLA is considered when the set date range is after the set SLA for the ticket.For tickets in the Closed bucket, over SLA is considered when the date the ticket was moved to the Closed bucket was after the set SLA date. |
| Total Tickets In SLA | The number of tickets that are within their SLA date or don't have an SLA date.For tickets not in the Closed bucket, in SLA is considered when the set SLA for the ticket is after the end of the set date range.For tickets in the Closed bucket, in SLA is considered when the date the ticket was moved to the Closed bucket was before the set SLA date. |
| Open Tickets Over SLA | The number of tickets not in the Closed bucket that went over their SLA date. Over SLA is considered when the set date range is over the set SLA for the ticket. |
| Open Ticket In SLA | The number of tickets not in the Closed bucket that are either within their SLA date or without an SLA date.In SLA is considered when the set SLA for the ticket is after the end of the set date range. |
| Total Closed Tickets | The number of tickets in the Closed bucket in the set date range. This includes tickets closed before the set date range. |
| Closed Tickets | The number of tickets that were set to the Closed bucket during the set date range.This measurement only counts tickets that were set to the Closed bucket within the set date range; tickets closed prior to the set date range are not counted. |
| Total Tickets | The number of tickets created up to the end of the set date range. |
| Critical Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive with critical severity that are not in the Closed bucket. |
| High Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive with high severity that are not in the Closed bucket. |
| Medium Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive with medium severity that are not in the Closed bucket. |
| Low Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive that are not in the Closed bucket with low severity. |
| Info Open Tickets | The number of tickets set as Active or Inactive with info severity that are not in the Closed bucket. |
| New Tickets Last 7 Days | The number of tickets created in the last 7 days. |
| Closed Tickets Last 7 Days | The number of tickets that were set to the Closed bucket in the last 7 days. |
| Undetected Tickets Last 7 Days | The number of tickets that were set as Inactive in the last 7 days. |
| Total Remediated Tickets | The number of tickets with a status from the Remediated bucket. |
| Remediated Tickets | The number of tickets that were set to a status from the Remediated bucket during the set date range.This measurement only counts tickets that were set to the Remediated bucket within the set date range; tickets set as Remediated prior to the set date range are not counted. |
| Undetected Tickets | The number of tickets that were set to an Inactive state (meaning all their findings were set as undetected) during the set date range.This measurement only counts tickets that turned inactive in the set date range. |
| Total Undetected Tickets | The number of tickets with an Inactive state in the set date range. |
Percentage Measurements
The following table shows information about percentage measurements in tickets:
| **Name** | **Expression** |
| -------- | -------------- |
| % Total Tickets Over SLA | Tickets Over SLA / Total Tickets |
| % Total Tickets In SLA | Tickets In SLA / Total Tickets |
| % Remediation | Inactive findings / Total findings |
| % Open Tickets Over SLA | Open Tickets Over SLA / Total Open Tickets |
| % Open Tickets In SLA | Open Tickets In SLA / Total Open Tickets |
Time to Measurements
The following table shows information about ticket time measurements:
