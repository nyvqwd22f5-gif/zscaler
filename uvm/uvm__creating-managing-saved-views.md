Saved views are configurable, reusable views that apply filters, grouping, sorting, and field selections to data. They are available across pages (e.g., Tickets, Findings, Assets, and Exceptions in UVM; Assets and Policy Violations in AEM) and system dashboards (e.g., Risk and Remediation History in UVM; Policy Compliance and Coverage and Gap in AEM). Saved views improve data exploration and analysis by allowing users to return to specific data configurations without reapplying settings each time.
Your account is equipped with system-saved views, which are configured to reflect common use cases. You can create additional custom views that reflect your organization's specific workflows, investigation patterns, and reporting needs.
Saved views are located in the drop-down menu above the entity table.

When managing saved views, you can perform the following actions:
- [Reset the Default View](#reset-default-view)
- [Favorite Views](#add-to-favorites)
- [Create a New View](#create-new-view)
- [Edit Views](#edit-views)
- [Delete Views](#delete-views)

[]Your default view determines what you first see when opening a particular page. For example, the default view of the Tickets page in the UVM app is Active, which is set to display only active tickets.
You can customize the default view at two levels:
-
Personal default view: In the saved views drop-down menu, click the **Set as my default view** icon next to the view name. This sets the selected view as the default for you only.

-
Set the account-wide default view: In the saved views drop-down menu, click the **Set as Account Default View** icon next to the view name. This sets the selected view as the default for all users in the account.

[]To access frequently used views, you can add views to the favorites list. Favorited views are displayed at the top of the saved views list.
To add a view to the favorites list, click the **Add to Favorite** icon next to the view name.

[]You can create a custom view by adjusting filters, displayed fields, grouping, and sorting.
To create a new saved view:
- Apply filters, sorting, and other settings to the table.
-
Click **Save as View **at the top-right corner of the page.
[See image.](#saved-as-view-button)
-
In the dialog window:
- **View Name**: Enter a name for the view.
- **View Permissions**: Set to either **Public** (i.e., visible to all users in the account) or **Private** (i.e., visible only to you).
- **Set as Account Default View**: Select the checkbox to set this view as the default view for all users in the account.
[See image.](#save-as-view-dialog)
- Click **Save**.

[]You can edit custom views that you created to update the view's settings (i.e., the view's name and permissions).
You can't edit system views and views that were created by other users.
To edit a custom saved view:

To edit the view's configuration (e.g., filtering, displayed fields, grouping), adjust the view as needed and click **Save View** at the top-right of the page.
[]You can delete custom views that you created to remove them from the available saved views.
You can't delete system views and views that were created by other users.
To delete a custom saved view:
- Select the view from the saved views drop-down menu.
- Hover over the view and click the **Delete **icon.
The view is deleted immediately.
