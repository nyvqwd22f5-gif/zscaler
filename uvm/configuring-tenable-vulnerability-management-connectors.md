Tenable Vulnerability Management automatically discovers and assesses a customer's environment for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other cybersecurity issues.
To create the Tenable VM data source, go to **Configure** > **Sources**. The connector tile appears among the other available data sources. To learn more, see [Creating Data Sources](/uvm/creating-data-sources).
[See image.](#tenable-vm-tiles)
There are three available** **Tenable Vulnerability Management connectors:
- Vulnerabilities: Retrieves vulnerabilities across the scanned assets broken down by CVE.
- Issues: Retrieves vulnerabilities with no associated CVEs.
- Assets: Retrieves data related to assets scanned by Tenable, e.g., endpoints, servers, network devices, web app.
The Issues stream and the Vulnerabilities stream are identical, with the exception that the Issues stream does not include CVE information.
If you’re looking to configure the Tenable Security Center (SC) connectors, see [Configuring the Tenable SC Connectors](https://help.zscaler.com/uvm/configuring-tenable-sc-connectors).

Authentication
The source Authentication configuration requires the following parameters:
- [Access Key and Secret Key](#access-key-secret-key)
[]To generate an Access Key and Secret Key, you first need to create a user with the necessary permissions, then generate the keys within that user's account.
Creating a Tenable User
To create a user with the necessary permissions:
- Log in to Tenable VM and go to **Settings **>** Access Control**.
- On the **Users** tab:
-
Click **Create User**.
The **Create User** window appears.
- In the **Create User** window:
- **General**: Fill in the primary user details.
- **User Groups**: Can be left empty.
- **Permissions**:** **Can be left empty; the user will be assigned at least **Can View** privileges for **All Assets**. Instructions on creating permissions are detailed below.
- **Role**: Select **Basic User**. To learn more, refer to the [Tenable documentation](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Settings/access-control/TenableRolePrivileges.htm?_gl=1*1a7sb4v*_gcl_au*MTA5NTE4OTIzNC4xNzI2MzkwNTk2*_ga*NzYzOTc1NjYuMTcyNjM4OTc5NQ..*_ga_HSJ1XWV6ND*MTcyODM5OTc0NC4yLjEuMTcyODQwMDc4OS4zMC4wLjQzODIxNjY1Ng..).
[See image.](#role-basic-user)
- **API Key**: Enable to allow the user to authenticate through an API key.
- **Username/Password**:** **Enable to allow the user to authenticate with a username and password.
[See image.](#authentication-toggles)
- Click **Save**
- On the **Permissions **tab:
-
Click** Create Permission**.
The **Create Permission** window appears.
- In the **Create Permission** window:
-
**Permissions Name**:** **Enter an informative name for the permission.
[See image.](#create-permissions-window)
- **Users**: Select the user created above.
- **Groups**: Can be left empty.
- **Permissions**: Select **Can View**.
- **Objects**: Select **All Assets**.
- Click **Save**
Generating the Access Key and Secret Key
The Tenable VM access key is an API Key associated with a user account with the required permissions.
To generate the Access Key and Secret Key:
- Log in to Tenable VM with the user you created above.
- In your Profile menu at the top right of the page, select **My Profile**.
- In the left-side navigation, click the **API Keys**.
- Click **Generate**.
-
Copy the API** Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
[See image.](#api-keys-page)
Save the access key and secret key securely, as you won’t be able to view them again after closing this page..

Retrieval
In the source setup Retrieval section, set the following filters and specifications:
- [Split findings by Output](#split-findings-by-output)
- [Include Info-Level Severity Data](#include-info-level-severity-data)
[]The Split findings by Output checkbox splits raw data records based on the output field, so that each resulting record contains a unique output.
The Split findings by Output** **checkbox is applicable in the following streams:
- Tenable Vulnerability Management - Vulnerabilities
- Tenable Vulnerability Management - Issues
[]The Include Info-Level Severity Data checkbox allows you to include vulnerabilities with info-level severity in your data, which are otherwise automatically filtered out.
The Include Info-Level Severity Data checkbox is applicable in the following streams:
- Tenable Vulnerability Management – Vulnerabilities
- Tenable Vulnerability Management – Issues
Roles and Permissions
The access key and secret key must be generated by a user with Can View permissions for All Assets.
Troubleshooting and FAQs
Why doesn’t the number of findings in Tenable match the data displayed on the platform?
The discrepancy in vulnerability counts between Tenable and our platform stems from differences in vulnerability processing and aggregation. Tenable reports vulnerabilities at the plugin level, which includes a group of related CVEs. In contrast, our platform decomposes each Tenable plugin into its constituent CVEs.
To illustrate this difference, consider the [Nessus Plugin - ID 141937](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/141937). In Tenable, this plugin is treated as a single vulnerability, whereas our platform splits this to the 48 distinct CVEs that comprise the plugin. These 48 findings are then aggregated into a single ticket.
