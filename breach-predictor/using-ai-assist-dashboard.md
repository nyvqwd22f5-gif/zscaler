The Breach Predictor AI Assist dashboard provides a flexible and intuitive way to gain insight into your organization's threat landscape. Powered by multiple Breach Predictor AI agents, the AI Assist dashboard draws on AI and machine learning analysis of vast amounts of data from multiple log sources, peer best practices, current policy settings, third-party integrations, and cutting-edge threat data from [Zscaler ThreatLabz](https://threatlabz.zscaler.com/), the security research arm of Zscaler.
The AI Assist** **dashboard is a dynamic piece of the Breach Predictor Portal, and the information available to you is customized specifically for your organization. This article walks you through a basic use case for analyzing information provided on the dashboard.
On any screen in the Breach Predictor Portal, you can click AI Assist to open the dashboard:

At the top of the AI Assist dashboard, you see the status of the Breach AI Agents that are actively monitoring and analyzing threats across your organization:

The agents monitor specific areas across your organization:
- **Detection**: This agent detects threats across your organization.
- **Context**: This agent provides additional details about specific threats (e.g., affected users, assets, etc.).
- **Triage**: This agent triages the threats in your organization to provide an initial verdict and confidence level for each threat.
- **Response**: This agent responds to each threat, and provides next steps to address threats.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: This agent monitors the third-party applications you've integrated with Breach Predictor and helps you perform tasks based on those integrations (e.g., log a policy update ticket in Jira, etc.).
The AI Assist dashboard greets you with customized recommendations to address the most urgent security threats facing your organization.

On each recommendation, you can drill down to see more information. For example, you can click the Top Response Actions tile to see a prioritized list of recommended policy updates from the Response Agent.

To return to the AI Assist splash page, click the + icon in the left-side navigation:

On each of the pages in the AI Assist dashboard, you can click one of the suggested prompts to get more information, or you can enter your own question in the text box. The prompts change dynamically based on the current screen you're viewing and the primary AI agent being engaged. You can also provide feedback (i.e., thumbs up and thumbs down) to help Breach Predictor's AI agents learn more and refine their responses.

Additionally, many pages in the AI Assist dashboard contain links to other areas of the Breach Predictor Portal that let you drill down to find details about a user, activity, or threat. In the following example, a request for AI triage information about the CobaltStrike threat family provides extensive evidence and justification about Breach Predictor's findings for the threat, as well as a link to the Findings page in the Breach Predictor Portal to find even more information about CobaltStrike.
