The Breach Predictor User Threat Profile** **page provides a threat profile for the users in your organization. At a high level, the Breach Predictor User Threat Profile** **page is designed to give you an overview of how threats are affecting users across your organization, broken down by MITRE ATT&CK  stage, department, threat type, and geography. As with other areas in the Breach Predictor Portal, you can easily move from a broad view of groups of users to a more narrow view of individual users.
On the User Threat Profile** **page, the Overview** **tab lets you quickly see how threats are affecting users at a macro level. You can then use the Users List tab to examine how the threats are affecting individual users. On each tab, you can filter by users and threats.
