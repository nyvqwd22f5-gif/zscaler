Breach Predictor Events help to keep you from getting lost in granular data so that you can maintain a clear view of the bigger security picture. You can use the Events page to filter and analyze all the allowed events that have affected your organization during a particular time period. Much like the [Findings page for a threat family](/breach-predictor/about-findings), the Events page gives you a high-level overview for all threats, and it allows you to drill down to see individual threats, individual users, and granular detail about each threat event. You can also adjust the time frame to gain more insight into how various threat families have affected your organization over time.
Events provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Monitor the allowed events that have affected your organization over time.
- Use multiple filters to get a more granular view of threats affecting your organization.
