Tickets let you track requests (known as Request tickets) filed by your organization to make policy updates based on recommendations from Breach Predictor. Additionally, you can use Support tickets to suggest improvements or log software bugs. To see the tickets filed by your organization, you must integrate Breach Predictor with Jira or ServiceNow. To learn more, see [Integrating Applications with Zscaler Breach Predictor](/breach-predictor/integrating-applications-zscaler-breach-predictor).
Tickets provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Track Request tickets filed with Zscaler Support for policy updates based on Breach Predictor findings and recommendations.
- Track and log Support tickets filed with Zscaler Support for general improvements and software bugs.
