Breach Predictor provides multiple options for viewing and analyzing data around the threat events affecting your organization. For policy update recommendations, Breach Predictor shows you the events associated with individual threat families so that you have complete visibility across the MITRE ATT&CK  matrix and can anticipate next moves. For that granular view, use the [Findings page](/breach-predictor/about-findings) to drill down and focus on the events around a particular threat family, and to see the policy updates that Breach Predictor recommends for mitigating each threat.
For a more macro view of threat events, you can use the [Events page](/breach-predictor/about-events) so that you have visibility across time for multiple threat families simultaneously. By default, Breach Predictor shows events for all threat families and all users. At the top right of the page, you can use the drop-down menu to filter by time period.

At the top left of the page, you can use the Threat drop-down menu to filter by one or more threat families, and you can use the Users drop-down menu to filter by one or more users in your organization.

As you select multiple threat families or users, you can hover over each drop-down menu to see the list of options in your filter.

As you filter by threat family and user, the By Tactics options update to indicate the MITRE ATT&CK  tactics associated with the selected threat families. Select a tactic to update the results on the page.

The Events allowed over time bar chart shows you a high-level view of the threat events that Zscaler identified for each day during the selected time period. To see the total number of events on a particular day, hover over the bar for the day. You can also use the handle on either end of the chart to adjust the events shown on the page.
