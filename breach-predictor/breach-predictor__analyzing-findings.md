After you've examined your organization's threat information on the [Dashboard](/breach-predictor/analyzing-dashboard), you can use the MITRE ATT&CK  Mapping Findings page to take a deeper look into specific information about the malware families affecting your users. On the Findings page, you can see detailed information about each malware family affecting your organization, including location on the MITRE ATT&CK  matrix, specific users affected by each malware family, and, most importantly, the achieved and expected attack for each malware family.
To open the **Findings** page, click **Findings **in the left-side navigation, or click the **Explore **button on the **Dashboard **page.
To learn more, see [About Findings](/breach-predictor/about-findings) and [Evaluating a Security Issue with Breach Predictor](/breach-predictor/evaluating-security-issue-breach-predictor).
Data about the malware families affecting your organization is divided into two main sub-pages on the Findings page, designed to provide a progressively greater level of detail:
- [Analyzing Data on the MITRE ATT&CK  Mapping Page](#mapping-page)
- [Analyzing Data on the Threat Page](#threat-page)
[]The MITRE ATT&CK  Mapping matrix is the first thing you’ll see on the Findings page. It’s designed to give you insight into all the malware families affecting your organization, and to specifically let you know which families pose the biggest threat. You can use the various toggles and filters to limit the information you see in the MITRE ATT&CK  Mapping view. As a general rule, you should use the following basic order of operations to triage the malware family threats in your organization. As you triage threats, Breach Predictor provides multiple options to drill down for more information:
- Look at results across time: Use the drop-down menu in the upper right of the **Findings **page to specify a time period for the data you see. Start small to check more immediate threats and then expand the search.
- Pay close attention to placement on the MITRE ATT&CK  matrix: Scroll through the list of malware families and look for indicators that one has moved to the far-right side of the matrix, focusing especially on the techniques in the Lateral Movement and Data Loss stages. If you see an indicator of lateral movement, you can drill down for more information.
- Focus on the severity score for each malware family: The score ranges from 1 to 10 and is assigned by [Zscaler ThreatLabz](https://threatlabz.zscaler.com/) to indicate how much harm a malware family can do to your organization. Start with the malware families that have higher severity scores.
- Monitor the total number of malware families: After you have triaged the most urgent malware families, work to reduce the total number of malware families affecting your organization.
[]When you click the name of a threat family in the list on the MITRE ATT&CK  Mapping page, the Threat page opens to provide granular detail on the selected threat. The Threat page contains the Attack path, Users, and Events tabs. Perhaps most importantly, the Threat page is where Breach Predictor provides policy update recommendations to preemptively eliminate attack paths in your organization.
- [Analyzing Data on the Attack Path Tab](#attack-path-tab)
- [Analyzing Data on the Users Tab](#users-tab)
- [Analyzing Data on the Events Tab](#events-tab)
[]The Attack path tab is at the heart of Breach Predictor’s advanced visibility and predictive modeling. In this view, you can quickly see the actual lateral movement that a malware family has achieved, as well as where the threat is expected to move next. For stages that a threat family has achieved, you can see at a glance the source of the threat data (e.g., threats identified from CrowdStrike logs are identified by the CrowdStrike logo, threats identified from Zscaler logs are identified by the Zscaler logo, etc.).

You can use the various toggles and filters to limit the information you see on the page. As a general rule, you should use the following basic order when addressing attack-path data for a malware family:
- Focus on advanced stages: Determine whether a technique has actually been reached, or whether Breach Predictor is predicting its advancement. Some events are identified as "possible," meaning that they might have happened but were not captured as part of Breach Predictor's threat detection. For threats that have achieved an advanced stage, you must act with urgency to bring the appropriate teams across your organization together to address the issues.
- Use the threat source information that Breach Predictor provides to determine which policy updates are necessary: For each attack stage, Breach Predictor provides information about where users encountered the threat. Click **Update Policy** to open the **Recommendation** panel and [create a Jira ticket for policy updates](/breach-predictor/requesting-updates-zscaler-breach-predictor).

- Click **AI Assist** to see generative AI information about the threat: The threat summary includes general information from Zscaler ThreatLabz, as well as specific information from Breach Predictor's analysis of the threats posed at each attack stage, including the log source for the threat data.

[]The Users tab is designed to give you a quick overview of all users affected by the selected threat in your organization. Specifically, the Users tab lets you see where the threat is moving or has moved for each affected user:
- Pay close attention to placement on the MITRE ATT&CK  matrix: The **Users **view shows the most advanced MITRE ATT&CK  technique either predicted or achieved by the malware family for each affected user. To determine actual MITRE ATT&CK  data, look at the attack path. The idea is to focus on the MITRE ATT&CK  placement for each user so that you can anticipate and prevent lateral movement to the next technique.
- Look at individual data as needed: Click the name of a user in the list to open the **Events** tab to see all events related to the selected threat for the user.
[]You can use various toggles and filters to limit the information you see on the tab. In this view, you see the events for a particular time frame for a single threat as it relates to a single user. For a broader view of threat activity in your organization, you can open the [Events page](/breach-predictor/about-events). Breach Predictor provides an easy way to view individual logs, but you should focus on the attack-path data so that you can anticipate and prevent lateral movement to the next MITRE ATT&CK  technique. As a general rule, you should use the following basic order of operations to examine user data for a particular malware family:
- Pay close attention to trends for the user: The **Events **table provides high-level data about each threat event for the selected user. In the table, you can see important information, such as which MITRE ATT&CK  technique was achieved, and which URL exposed the user to the threat.
- Look at granular data as needed: By clicking an event in the table, you can open the **Event Detail** panel to see specific information about the threat. You can also download the data for the event.
