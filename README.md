# Zscaler Help → Markdown (API Docs Only)

Welcome! 👋 This directory is a collection of Markdown exports from the Zscaler help center/API documentation at `https://help.zscaler.com`. It is **not** the SDK—just the published help and API docs, rendered to Markdown so they’re easy to browse, search, or index. Use it for educational and reference purposes.

## What you’ll find
- Help and API articles pulled from the public Zscaler help site.
- Markdown files organized by their URL paths, using `__` between path segments (e.g., `/zdx/understanding-rate-limiting` → `zdx__understanding-rate-limiting.md` inside the `zdx` folder).
- Only real content: placeholder pages like sitemaps or missing pages are skipped.

## How to use
- Browse the folders and open any `.md` file to read the doc.
- If you want to map a Markdown file back to its source, the filename mirrors the original URL path.

## Notes
- This snapshot is for learning/reference and isn’t affiliated with or endorsed by Zscaler.
- No SDK code is included here—just the docs content.
