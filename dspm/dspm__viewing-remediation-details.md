You can manually remediate the [alerts](/dspm/about-alerts) generated for a [policy](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies). The Remediation tab provides detailed steps that you need to perform in your cloud service provider (CSP) to address the policy violation. After the violation is addressed in the CSP, all the corresponding alerts generated for that policy are [resolved](/dspm/alert-status).
When you remediate an alert, the policy violation is resolved in the CSP and the DSPM Admin Portal. The alert moves from the Open state to the Resolved state.
To view the remediation details:
- Go to **Alerts** > **Alert Views** > **Alerts**.
- Select the **All Alerts** tab.
-
Click the **Alert ID**.

You can also access the Remediation tab from the [Grouped by Policy](/dspm/viewing-alerts-grouped-policy) tab, [Grouped by Resource](/dspm/viewing-alerts-grouped-resource) tab, [Dashboard](/dspm/about-dashboard), and the [Resource Inventory](/dspm/about-resource-inventory) page.
