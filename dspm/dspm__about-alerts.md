DSPM continuously scans your cloud resources against the [policies](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies) enabled in your cloud accounts to identify vulnerabilities and generate alerts. When a policy violation is detected, DSPM generates alerts and sends notifications to recipients to take action and prevent any potential breaches.
An alert is an outcome of a policy evaluation done on a resource type (e.g., S3 bucket, database). For example, If a security policy is enabled to detect any publicly exposed S3 bucket containing sensitive data, and there are 5 such S3 buckets in your cloud storage, DSPM generates 5 alerts.
Alerts are categorized by severity level to help you prioritize them and take action in a timely manner.
Alerts provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View and manage alert notifications for any security policy violations detected in the cloud accounts.
- Notify recipients to take action and prevent any potential breaches.
- Stay informed about critical security events.

[]On the All Alerts tab, you can do the following:
- View the list of alerts generated for policy violations. For each alert, you can view:
- **Alert ID**: The unique identifier for the alert. Click** **to [view additional details](/dspm/viewing-alert-details).
- **Resource Name**: The name of the resource.
- **Policy Name**: The policy title.
- **Policy Category**: The [threat category](/dspm/threat-categories) (**Public Exposure**, **Data Loss**, etc.) to which the policy belongs.
- **Resource Type**: The type of data store (**AWS EC2 instance**, **AWS S3 bucket**, etc.).
- **Resource ID**: The unique identifier for the resource.
-
**Risk Level**: The risk level (**Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**) of the alert.
The risk level of an alert is calculated as the average of the policy severity and the resource impact. For example, if the policy severity is Critical and the resource impact is Medium, then the alert risk level is High.
- **Alert Status**: The status (**Open**, **Closed**, **Resolved, **and** Snoozed**) of the alert.
- **Cloud Account**: The unique identifier of the cloud account (**AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP**, **Snowflake**, and **On-Premises**) in which the resource is located.
- **Created Date**: The date and time the alert was generated.
- **Last Updated**: The date and time the alert was last updated.
