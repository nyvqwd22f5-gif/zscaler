The Timeline tab on the [Resource Inventory page](/dspm/about-resource-inventory) provides a consolidated view of events related to configuration changes made to a resource for a given period of time. DSPM provides complete visibility into the changes made to the resource, the entity that made the change, and the time at which it occurred. This allows you to investigate and remediate the issue and maintain the security posture.
The resource timeline is limited to a maximum of 30 days.
To view the events related to a resource:
-
Go to **Analytics **> **Resource Inventory**.
The **Resource Inventory** page appears.
