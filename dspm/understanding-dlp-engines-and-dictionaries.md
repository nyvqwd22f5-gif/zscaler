A DLP engine is a security solution that comprises a collection of one or more DLP dictionaries. A DLP dictionary contains a set of patented algorithms that are designed to detect specific types of information in your cloud resources, users' traffic, and activities. DLP engines are used to identify sensitive data and prevent data breaches. By using a DLP engine, you can create policy rules to detect content that encompasses more than one dictionary. For example, if your organization wants to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card numbers, you can create a rule using a DLP engine that contains the PII and Credit Cards dictionaries. The Zscaler service provides predefined DLP engines and supports custom DLP engines.
