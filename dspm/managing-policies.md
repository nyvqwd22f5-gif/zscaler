Editing a custom data posture policy might have an impact on the alerts that DSPM generates. If you edit any custom policy, such as the policy title or remediation procedure, the new information is displayed on the [Alerts page](/dspm/about-alerts) and the dashboard. If you edit the custom policy query logic, DSPM determines that the custom policy has changed and closes all existing alerts, and generates new alerts based on the updated custom policy query logic.
You can edit or delete only the custom policies. Predefined policies cannot be edited or deleted.
To edit a custom data posture policy:
- Go to **Policy** > **Data Posture Policies**.
- On the **Policy** page, click the **Actions** icon for the required custom policy.
-
Click **Edit**.
You are directed to the **Query Builder** page.
- On the **Query Builder** page, [edit the query](/dspm/creating-custom-policies)[ ]as required.
-
When you are done editing the query, click **Test Run**.
The query results are displayed in the **Policy Test Result** window.
[See image.](#ds-edittestresult)
- Click **Accept and Proceed**.
- On the **Remediation Procedure** page, click **Add Remediation Procedure**.
-
Enter the remediation steps in Markdown format, then click **Save**. If you've already added the remediation procedure, then click the **Edit** icon to modify the text, if required.

- Click **Next**.
-
On the **Severity and Description** page, edit any of the values as required.
[See image.](#ds-editseverity)
- Click **Save Changes**.
[]
When you delete a custom policy, all alerts previously generated by the policy are closed.
To delete a custom data posture policy:
- Go to **Policy** > **Data Posture Policies**.
-
On the **Policy** page, click the **Actions** icon for the required custom policy.
[See image.](#ds-deletepolicy)

Read the confirmation message, then click **Delete**.

You can clone a predefined or an existing custom policy by reusing its query structure and modifying some parameters, as required, to create another custom policy.
To clone a policy:
- Go to **Policy** > **Data Posture Policies**.
-
On the **Policy** page, click the **Actions** icon (![ds-actionsicon.png](/downloads/dspm/policies/cloning-policy/ds-actionsicon.png)
) and select the **Clone** option for the required policy.
[See image.](#ds-doption)
You cannot clone policies that are temporarily hidden.
-
In the **Duplicate Policy** window, select the checkbox to confirm that you want to proceed, then click **Clone**.
[See image.](#ds-confirmwindow)
You are directed to the **Query Builder** page.
-
On the **Query Builder** page, add additional predicates to the query if required.
[See image.](#ds-addquery)
-
Continue with the remaining steps to [create the policy](/dspm/creating-custom-policies).
The new policy is created and displayed on the **Policy** page.

You can change the severity of a data posture policy as required. When you change the policy severity, it impacts the alert risk level that is triggered for any findings by this policy.
You cannot edit, delete, or change the severity level for predefined policies.

- Go to **Policy** > **Data Posture Policies**.
- On the **Policy** page, select the checkbox of the required policy.

-
Click the **Actions** drop-down menu and select **Change Severity**.
[See image.](#ds-Actionsdrop-down)
-
In the **Change Policy Severity** window, select one of the following options from the **Policy Severity** drop-down menu:
- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low
[See image.](#ds-changeseverity)
- Click the **I understand the consequences and want to proceed** checkbox.
