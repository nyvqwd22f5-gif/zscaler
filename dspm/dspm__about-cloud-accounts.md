Data security is an important aspect of security practices. Organizations need to ensure that data in their cloud accounts is stored, shared, and transferred securely to the right people and services for the right purpose. It is also crucial to know where the data is located, what type of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, login credentials) exists in your cloud accounts, who has access to it, and how secure the data is to prevent any potential data breach.
DSPM continuously monitors and scans the onboarded cloud accounts for sensitive data and vulnerabilities, and generates [alerts](/dspm/about-alerts) based on data security [policy](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies) violations. DSPM supports the onboarding of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/dspm/onboarding-aws-organization) accounts, [Microsoft Azure](/dspm/onboarding-microsoft-azure-tenant) subscriptions, and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/dspm/onboarding-gcp-organization) projects.
Onboarding cloud accounts to DSPM provide the following benefits:
- Gain visibility into all the data stored in the cloud accounts.
- Detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, potential threats that could lead to data breach.
- Respond to security risks and take necessary action to prevent data breach.
