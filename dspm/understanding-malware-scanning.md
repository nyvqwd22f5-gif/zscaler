Malware refers to any malicious code or application (e.g., spyware, adware, ransomware, rootkit) that infects endpoint devices and cloud resources, causing damage and disruption of normal activities. It is critical to detect malware and immediately remove it.
You can select the option to perform a malware scan while [configuring the scan settings](/dspm/about-scan-settings). DSPM scans your cloud resources for any malware. This allows you to immediately investigate and remove the malware from your cloud environment.
DSPM performs malware and sensitive data scanning on the same scan schedule. For example, if a storage account is being scanned for sensitive data, the malware scan happens either before, concurrently, or immediately after the sensitive data scan. The scan results are displayed on the [Data Inventory page](/dspm/about-data-inventory), and you can view the [malware details](/dspm/viewing-malware-details).
Zscaler uses an industry-leading AV vendor for signature-based detection and protection so it can provide comprehensive web security. In addition to virus and spyware protection, the service uses malware feeds from its trusted partners, such as Microsoft and Adobe, as well as its own technologies to detect and block malware.
