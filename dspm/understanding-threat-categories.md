DSPM groups common threats into different categories. The [policy violations](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies) are associated with a specific threat category and a [severity level](/dspm/understanding-security-risk), allowing you to analyze the issue and take the necessary action.
DSPM defines the following threat categories:
| **Threat Category** | **Description** |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Risky Credentials | User credentials are not secure (e.g., users without MFA, etc.). |
| Public Exposure | Publicly exposed resources. |
| Data Loss | Loss of data when some security controls are disabled (e.g., delete protection feature disabled, no backup, etc.) on the resource. |
| Data Governance | Data breach due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities (e.g., encryption or logging is disabled on the resource, backup feature disabled, etc.). |
| Malicious Access | Data accessed by malicious actors. |
| External Users | Data accessed by external users. |
