DSPM can scan the AWS or Azure virtual machines (VMs) and detect vulnerabilities, such as unencrypted data, publicly exposed instances, unauthorized access to sensitive data, etc. The scan results are displayed on the [Data Inventory page](/dspm/about-data-inventory). The vulnerability scanning is supported on the following operating systems, file systems, and programming language libraries.
- [Operating Systems](#os)
- [File Systems](#filesystems)
- [Programming Language Libraries](#apppackages)
[]Vulnerability scanning is supported for the following operating systems running on:
- [x86 Architecture](#xprocessor)
- [ARM Architecture](#armprocessor)
