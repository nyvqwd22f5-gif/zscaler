Zscaler Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) is an AI-powered solution to protect your organization’s data stored on-premises and in the cloud against data theft, misuse, or loss by continuously scanning the data for numerous potential misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and permissions that might contribute to attack vectors. DSPM provides detailed insights into where this sensitive data resides in your cloud environment, identifies and classifies sensitive data, detects duplicate data and misconfigurations in data stores containing sensitive data, and contextualizes data exposure and security posture.
DSPM aggregates security data and prioritizes risk based on severity, coupled with step-by-step remediation guidance and configurable, near-real-time alerts and notifications. Knowing the risk in full context enables security teams to resolve potential risks or threats. DSPM provides enriched and interactive dashboards, graphs, and reports that enable security teams to quickly evaluate the severity of the risk, remediate the issues, and prevent data breaches at scale. DSPM is crucial for an effective cloud data security posture management.
DSPM is robust and extends data security for cloud resources, on-premises data centers, and AI systems. It provides complete visibility into your AI services and data flows, blocks unsanctioned apps, and eliminates risks, enabling granular control over sensitive data accessed by AI systems. This helps prevent accidental exposure, overly permissive or unauthorized access, and potential compliance violations.

Key Features and Benefits
DSPM includes the following key features and benefits:
- **Monitor data**: Continuous data monitoring for any potential risks or vulnerabilities.
- **Secure sensitive data**: Discover sensitive data and its access level in your cloud environments, classify this data based on severity, and identify areas of exposure.
- **Policy and compliance**: Implement security policies to comply with stringent security and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, NIST).
- **Incident response**: Expedite identification, investigation, containment, and recovery in the event of a security incident.
- **Data duplication**: Detect duplicate files at multiple locations to manage redundant data, reduce attack surface, and limit exposure to unauthorized users.
- **AI services**: Discover, classify, and identify sensitive data that can be accessed by both managed and unmanaged AI services and models, and alert security teams to investigate and prevent breaches.
How Does DSPM Work?
DSPM comprises the following features to achieve continuous security, compliance, and governance for data in your cloud infrastructure:
- **Scan and monitor cloud and on-premises resources**: Works with minimal access to resources in cloud environments (AWS, Azure, and GCP), on-premises data centers, AI services, and discovers sensitive data.
- **Agentless deep scanning**: Uses an agentless approach to continuously scan resources (cloud storage, databases, virtual machines, on-premises data centers, AI systems).
- **Detect data misconfigurations**: Scans data for any vulnerabilities such as data exposure, publicly exposed sensitive data, over-privileged access to data without proper role-based access control (RBAC), sensitive data exposed to unmanaged AI services and models, etc.
- **Apply security policies**: Identifies security policy violations at the resource and data level. It also provides a complete mapping of security policies within various compliance frameworks.
- **AI data security**: Uses AI-powered classification to discover sensitive data accessed by AI services and training models and helps prevent data oversharing or poisoning by excluding sensitive data from training data sets.
- **Dashboard, graphs, and reports**: Intuitive dashboards, graphs, and analytical reports provide detailed insights into the risks and issues associated with sensitive data.
-
**Remediate issues**: Provides remediation for every issue enabling your organization to immediately take action and maintain a strong cloud data security posture.
