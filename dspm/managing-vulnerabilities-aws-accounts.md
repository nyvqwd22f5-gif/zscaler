DSPM scans your Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud accounts to detect vulnerabilities and displays the scan results on the [Data Inventory page](/dspm/about-data-inventory).
Vulnerability scanning is supported for both AWS-managed and customer-managed encryption. However, to support AWS-managed encryption, at least one customer-managed key should be present in the region.
