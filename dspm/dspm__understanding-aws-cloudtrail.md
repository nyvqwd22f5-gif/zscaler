AWS CloudTrail is a service that records activities as events. Any activity in your AWS account performed by a user, role, or an AWS service is recorded as a CloudTrail event. These CloudTrail events provide visibility into the AWS account (e.g., who took the action, when the event occurred, which resources were impacted). This helps in analyzing, troubleshooting, and maintaining the security posture of the AWS account.
There are three ways to record CloudTrail events:
- Event History: Records all activities within a single AWS account for the last 90 days.
- CloudTrail Lake: Records user and API activities within an AWS account or AWS organization.
- Trails: Records specific AWS activities that you want to monitor within an AWS account or organization and sends these logs to the Amazon S3 bucket.
DSPM uses trails to analyze the logs and perform incremental scans on the S3 buckets.
You can create trails for a single AWS account or multiple AWS accounts using organizations. When you create a trail using organization, a trail is created in each member account of the organization. The events are logged in each trail of the member account and are delivered to the S3 bucket. This enables centralized logging and monitoring of API activities across all accounts within an AWS organization. It allows you to aggregate CloudTrail logs from multiple accounts and regions into a single S3 bucket, making it easier to manage and analyze the logs for compliance, security, and operational purposes. This centralized logging capability provides better visibility and control over your cloud resources.
