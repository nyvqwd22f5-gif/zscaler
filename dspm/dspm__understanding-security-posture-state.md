Posture determines the security status of your cloud resources (S3 buckets, virtual machines, EC2 instances, GCP cloud storage, AI services, etc.). A strong security posture indicates that your cloud infrastructure is protected based on security standards and your organization's needs.
DSPM not only scans the resources for vulnerabilities, but also evaluates the security posture against [data posture policies](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies) and displays the posture state. Knowing the security posture allows you to quickly address the issue and ensure your resources are protected by implementing proper security controls and mitigating external attacks. To learn more, see [About Resource Inventory](/dspm/about-resource-inventory).
The following icons indicate the security posture of the resources:
- **Bad Posture **icon (![Bad%20State%20Icon.png](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/dspm-draft-articles/about-dashboard-draft-0/Bad%20State%20Icon.png)
): Bad state. The data is not encrypted.
- **Partially Good Posture **icon (![Intermediate%20State%20Icon.png](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/dspm-draft-articles/understanding-security-posture-state-draft/Intermediate%20State%20Icon.png)
): Intermediate state. The data is partially encrypted. For example, data is encrypted with platform-managed keys (PMK). This is secure than no encryption at all, but encrypting with customer-managed keys (CMK) is more secure.
- No icon: Good state. The resource is secure and there are no issues. For example, data is encrypted with CMK.

Posture State
DSPM identifies the following posture states:
| Security Posture | Posture State | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Encryption | Encrypted | Data is encrypted. |
|  | Not Encrypted | Data is not encrypted, putting the data at high risk. |
|  | CMK Encrypted | Data is encrypted with customer-managed keys (CMK), which is best practice. |
|  | PMK Encrypted | Data is encrypted with platform-managed keys (PMK), which is less secure than encryption with customer-managed keys (CMK). |
|  | Partial Encryption | Encryption is partially enabled for this data store. |
| Public Exposure | Publicly Exposed | The network settings allow public access from the internet to this resource, which is considered a bad practice for resources containing sensitive data. |
|  | Not Exposed | The network settings prevent access from the internet to this resource, which is best practice. |
| Logging | Logging Enabled | All relevant data and management logs are enabled for this data store, which is best practice. |
|  | Logging Disabled | Data and management activities on this data store are not logged. Logging enables fast incident response. No logs means no visibility into such activities. |
|  | Partial Logging | Logging is partially enabled for this data store, blocking visibility into some data or management activities. |
| Backup | Backup Enabled | Data backup policy is implemented, which is best practice. |
|  | No Backup | Data backup policy is not implemented. Data backup policy is crucial to prevent data loss through data theft or accidental deletion. |
| Data Retention | Data Retention Enabled | Data retention policy is implemented, which is best practice. |
|  | No Data Retention Policy | Data retention policy is not implemented. Data retention policy is crucial to prevent stale information. |
| Exposure to AI Services | Exposed to AI Service | The sensitive data in data stores is exposed to an AI service. |
|  | Not Exposed to AI Service | The sensitive data in data stores is not exposed to an AI service. |
| Guardrails | Enabled | Guardrails are configured. (AWS Bedrock Agent or Azure AI Foundry) |
|  | Disabled | Guardrails are not configured. (AWS Bedrock Agent or Azure AI Foundry) |
| Unmanaged AI Services |  | The virtual machine runs one or more AI models deployed from an open-source model like Hugging Face or Ollama. |
| AI Tools |  | The virtual machine runs one or more AI or machine learning packages. |
| Privileged | Privileged Access | The identity has more permissions than it requires. |
|  | Not - Privileged Access | The identity does not have excessive privileges. |
| Account Status | Account Active | The account is active. |
|  | Account Inactive | The account is not active. |
| Newly Created |  | The identity was recently created. |
| Established Identity |  | The identity is an established identity. |
| Password Status | Stale Password | The password is not valid and has not been changed for more than 90 days. |
|  | Password Not Stale | The password is valid. |
| MFA Status | MFA Enabled | MFA is enabled for the identity. |
|  | MFA Disabled | MFA is disabled for the identity. |
| MFA Method | Weak MFA | The MFA is not secure. |
|  | Strong MFA | The MFA is secure and compliant. |
|  | MFA Not Registered | MFA is not set up for the identity. |
| Directory Admin Privileges | Directory Admin | The identity has admin privileges to access the directory. |
| Self-Service Password | Self-Service Password Enabled | Self-service password reset option is enabled for the identity. |
|  | Self-Service Password Disabled | Self-service password reset option is disabled for the identity. |
| Clear Text Keys | Clear Text Keys Found | Clear text keys are detected for the identity. |
|  | No Clear Text Keys | Clear text keys are not detected for the identity. |
| Dormant Identity |  | The identity is inactive for more than 90 days. |
| Active Identity |  | The identity is active. |
| Certificate Credentials | Has Certificate Credentials | The identity has certificate credentials. |
|  | No Certificate Credentials | The identity does not have certificate credentials. |
| 3rd-Party Application Access | 3rd-Party App Access | A third-party application has access to the identity. |
|  | No 3rd-Party App Access | No third-party application has access to this identity. |
| Dual Authentication | Dual Authentication Enabled | Dual authentication is enabled for the identity. |
|  | Dual Authentication Disabled | Dual authentication is disabled for the identity. |
| Access Key | Stale Access Key | The access key for the identity has not been rotated for more than 90 days. |
|  | Access Key Not Stale | The access key is valid. |
|  | Has Access Key | The identity has an active access key. |
|  | No Active Access Key | The identity does not have an active access key. |
| Certificate | Active Certificate | The identity has an active certificate. |
|  | Inactive Certificate | The identity does not have an active certificate. |
|  | Stale Certificate | The certificate for the identity is invalid and should be rotated. |
|  | Certificate Not Stale | The certificate is valid. |
| SCP Status | SCP Applied | Service Control Policy is applied to the AWS account. |
|  | No SCP Applied | Service Control Policy is not applied to the AWS account. |
