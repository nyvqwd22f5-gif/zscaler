You can enable or disable the [ignore alert filters](/dspm/adding-ignore-filters) you've added.
By default, the ignore alert filter is enabled. If the selected filters of the filter scope are deleted (e.g., policies are deleted, accounts are offboarded, or the business unit is deleted), the ignore alert filter is disabled. You can enable the filter only after the filter scope is updated.
To enable or disable the ignore alert filter:
- Go to **Alerts **> **Alert Settings** > **Ignore Alert Filter**.
-
Click the toggle under the **State** column to enable or disable the ignore alert filter.

-
A confirmation message appears indicating that the ignore alert filter is going to be enabled or disabled. Click **Enable** or **Disable** depending on the action.
