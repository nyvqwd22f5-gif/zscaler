You can use the On-Demand scan option to run a scan instantly on the database or virtual machine. The On-Demand scan overrides the scheduled scan. To learn more, see [About Scan Settings](/dspm/about-scan-settings).
To run an On-Demand scan:
- Go to **Administration** > **Scan Settings**.
- Select the **Scan Rules** tab.
-
Click the **Actions** icon (![ds-actionsicon.png](/downloads/dspm/scan-settings/managing-scan-settings/running-demand-scan/ds-actionsicon.png)
) for the scan rule you want to run.
