When a policy violation is detected in your cloud resources, DSPM generates alerts and notifies recipients to take action. These generated alerts are displayed on the [Alerts page](/dspm/about-alerts). Alerts that are initially generated are in Open status. When these alerts are evaluated and addressed, the status transitions to Resolved, Closed, or Snoozed.
DSPM alerts can have the following status:
- [](/dspm/about-data-posture-policies)
-
- [](/dspm/managing-alerts)[](/dspm/about-ignore-alert-filters)
- [](/dspm/supported-data-stores)[](/dspm/about-scan-settings)

| Alert Status | Description | Example Scenarios | Notes |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Open | The new alerts generated for a policy violation or resolved alerts for which policy violation is detected again. | A policy violation is detected.The policy violation is detected again within 180 days of resolving the alert. | An open alert moves to the resolved, closed, or snoozed state based on the latest policy findings, manual actions (resolve, snooze, unsnooze, or reset), or alert filter (ignore alert filter).When a data store is removed from the scan settings, the alerts remain open based on the posture assessment of the data store.An automatically resolved alert is reopened if the violation is detected within 180 days of resolving the alert. The Alert Status Reason in the Alerts drawer describes the reason for why the alert is reopened.DSPM generates a new alert if the policy violation is detected again after 180 days. |
| Closed | The alerts that are no longer valid. | The cloud account is offboarded.The cloud account is deleted from the CSP.The policy is edited, disabled, or deleted.The data store is deleted.The data store that was removed earlier is not added back to the scan settings. | A closed alert is the final state of an alert (i.e., it does not move to any other state).The alert graph for a closed alert is frozen and the nodes are unclickable.The Sensitive Data tab in the Alerts drawer is hidden.The closed alert is deleted from the DSPM Admin Portal after 180 days. |
| Resolved | The policy violation detected in the data store is fixed. | The alert is manually resolved in the DSPM Admin Portal.The policy violation is manually remediated.The policy violation is resolved in the CSP. | An automatically resolved alert moves to the open state if the issue is detected within 180 days of resolving the alert. DSPM generates a new alert if the policy violation is detected again after 180 days.A manually resolved alert remains in the resolved state until you reset it. When you reset the alert, the alert status is updated based on the latest policy findings.A resolved alert moves to the closed state if the data store, policy, or cloud account is deleted.The alert graph for a resolved alert is frozen, and the nodes are unclickable.The Sensitive Data tab in the Alerts drawer is hidden. |
| Snoozed | Alerts of low priority that are paused for a specific duration. | The alert is manually snoozed to pause notification for a specified duration. | A snoozed alert remains snoozed even if the policy violation is resolved in the CSP.If you unsnooze an alert or if the snooze period expires, the alert status changes to open or resolved based on the latest policy findings.If the data store or policy is deleted when the alert is snoozed, the alert moves to the closed state irrespective of the snooze period.If the policy violation is resolved in the CSP, the alert graph freezes, and the nodes become unclickable. |
