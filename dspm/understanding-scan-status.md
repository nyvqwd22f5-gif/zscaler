DSPM performs a data scan as per the schedule or the selected scan type and displays the results. However, if there are any issues in the data stores, DSPM cannot complete the process and this can result in different scan statuses.
The following statuses are supported:
- **Disabled**: The scan is turned off and does not run.
- **Scheduled**: The scan is planned to run at a specified time.
- **On-Demand** : The scan is manually triggered by the user.
- **In Progress**: The scan is actively in progress for both full scans and incremental scans.
