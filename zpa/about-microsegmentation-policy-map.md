The Microsegmentation Policy Map is an interactive graphical map of how your configured policies are working, displayed by AppZone. Real-time information of resource group data is layered in the graph, displaying configured policy data and resource information together in a single view.
The Microsegmentation Policy Map provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View the map of configured policies for your organization.
- View individual policy data.
- Filter policies based on AppZone.
On the Policy Map page (Microsegmentation > Policy > Policy Map), you can do the following:
- View traffic direction of rules and their resources at the highest level possible.
- Filter rules by AppZone using the drop-down menu.
- Click individual destinations to expand the side and bottom panel views that display detailed information.
