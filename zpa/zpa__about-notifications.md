Notifications provide information about events related to components, event information (e.g., high CPU), and relevant values associated with the events. Admins subscribe to receive event notifications from the ZPA Admin Portal by email. On the Notifications page, an admin can then filter and view notifications.
Notifications provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Receive notifications from the ZPA Admin Portal about events that are related to components, event information, and relevant values associated with the events.
- Configure events related to component enrollment, component connectivity and upgrades, component usage metrics, system resources, and backup configuration.
About the Notifications Page
On the Notifications page (Configuration & Control > Notification Management > Notifications), you can do the following:
- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to show the filters.
- Refresh the Notifications page to reflect the most current information.
- Filter the information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
