Admins can [configure](/zpa/configuring-appzones), [edit](/zpa/editing-appzones), and delete [AppZones](/zpa/about-appzones) as needed.
When you delete an AppZone, its matched flow doesn't appear in Flow Logs and any related resources become unmapped.
To delete an AppZone:
- Go to **Microsegmentation** > **Resource Management**.
- Click the **AppZones** tab.
- Click the **Delete** icon for the AppZone you want to delete.
The **Delete AppZone** confirmation window appears.

- Click **Delete**.

The page refreshes and removes the AppZone from the list.
