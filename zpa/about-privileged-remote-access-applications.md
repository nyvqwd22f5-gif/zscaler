Privileged Remote Access allows you to provide temporary remote access to specific applications with Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). Privileged Remote Access allows contractors and third-party users access to specific applications. You must first set up privileged portals and privileged consoles on the [Privileged Portals](/zpa/about-privileged-portals) and [Privileged Consoles](/zpa/about-privileged-consoles) pages.
Privileged Remote Access applications provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Quickly identify which application segments are enabled for Privileged Remote Access.
- See which ports and protocols have been configured for Privileged Remote Access.
- Apply filters to change the view of Privileged Remote Access-enabled application segments.

On the Privileged Remote Access page (Resource Management > Application Management > Privileged Remote Access), you can:
- Expand all the rows in the table to see more information about each application. Go to the [Application Segments](/zpa/about-applications) page to add a new application segment or manage existing application segments.
- Filter the information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied.
