SCIM Sync Logs are the audit of operations between the identity provider (IdP) and the SCIM service. Operations that change the state of the users and groups are presented on the SCIM Sync Logs page.
SCIM Sync Logs provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View the operations that change, add, update, or remove users, user attributes, and groups.
- Troubleshoot issues with group membership or user attribute updates.
About the SCIM Sync Logs Page
On the SCIM Sync Logs page (Authentication > User Authentication > SCIM Management > SCIM Sync Logs), you can do the following:

- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
