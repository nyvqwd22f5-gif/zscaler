Cloud Connectors are virtual machines (VMs) that simplify traffic forwarding to Zscaler services (i.e., Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access). The Cloud Connector also secures server access to the internet and provides direct connectivity to the Zscaler cloud, providing apps with highly secure and simplified access to the internet. To learn more, see [What Is Zscaler Cloud Connector?](/cloud-branch-connector/what-zscaler-cloud-connector)
Cloud Connectors provide the following benefits and allow you to:
- Extend the capabilities of Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) to cloud-native workloads, enabling enterprises to secure cloud workload communications over any network.
- Simplify multi-cloud networking by eliminating complex routing, virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewalls while allowing for flexible forwarding and simple policy management.
- Secure workload traffic to the internet and provide seamless connectivity to private applications in other cloud regions or data centers.
Cloud Connectors listed in the ZPA Admin Portal come from the Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal. You can create and update Cloud Connectors in the Cloud Connector Portal. To learn more, see [Accessing and Navigating the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal](/cloud-branch-connector/accessing-navigating-zscaler-cloud-branch-connector-admin-portal).
About the Cloud Connectors Page
On the Cloud Connectors page (Administration > Cloud Connectors), you can do the following:
- View a list of applied filters available from the current and previous user sessions. Applied filters must be saved to the user session first before they can be viewed. Use the drop-down menu to select the applied filters to view. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to display the filters.
- Filter the Cloud Connector information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
- Refresh the Cloud Connectors page to reflect the most current information.
- Expand all the rows in the table to see more information about each Cloud Connector.
- View a list of all deployed Cloud Connectors. For each deployed Cloud Connector, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the Cloud Connector.
- **Cloud Connector Group**: The name of the group that the Cloud Connector is part of.
- [Modify the columns displayed in the table.](/zpa/using-tables)
- Display more rows or a different page of the table.
- Open the [Zscaler Help Browser](/zpa/using-zscaler-help-browser) and view Help Portal articles without leaving the ZPA Admin Portal.
- Go to the [Cloud Connector Groups](/zpa/about-cloud-connector-groups) page to review your Cloud Connector groups.
