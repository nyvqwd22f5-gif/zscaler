The Settings page lets the customer control policy enforcement settings at a global level. Admins can enable or disable policy settings at any time. Admins can also allow or block the Default Resource Policy Rule that they configured when first enabling policy enforcement. To learn more, see [Configuring the Default Microsegmentation Policy](/zpa/configuring-default-microsegmentation-policy).
To update the policy settings:
- Go to **Microsegmentation** > **Policy** > **Settings**.
- Enable or disable **Policy Enforcement**.
- Allow or block the **Default Resource Policy Rule**.

Updates to settings take effect immediately. If you have enabled these settings but are unable to configure policy rules, contact your Microsegmentation administrator.
