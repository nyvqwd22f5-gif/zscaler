Role-based access control (RBAC) for all ZPA API operations ensures that access to API endpoints is restricted or granted based on user roles and permissions.
RBAC for ZPA API provides the following benefits and enable you to:
- Enhance security and operational efficiency by ensuring that users only have access to the resources and actions necessary for their specific roles.
- Reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
Enforcing RBAC
To enforce RBAC for the ZPA API:
- [Create a predefined or custom role](/zpa/configuring-administrator-roles) in the ZPA Admin Portal.
- [Create an API client](/zidentity/adding-api-client) in the ZIdentity Admin Portal.
