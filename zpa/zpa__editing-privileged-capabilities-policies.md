To edit a privileged capabilities policy rule:
- Go to **Policy** > **Privileged Policy** > **Privileged Capabilities Policies**.
- Locate the privileged capabilities policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit** icon.
If you only want to change a privileged capabilities policy rule's place in the Rule Order, you can manually enter a new value on the [Privileged Capabilities Policy page](/zpa/about-privileged-capabilities-policy).
- In the **Edit Privileged Capabilities Policy** window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Privileged Capabilities Policies](/zpa/configuring-privileged-capabilities-policies).
