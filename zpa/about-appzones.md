AppZones in Microsegmentation are applications grouped together into "zones" based on the applications' topology and their underlying network connectivity with each other. Admins can use AppZones to segment different resources that use these applications to track usage. The AppZones page gives insight into your organization's complete list of AppZone data. It allows you to monitor and analyze the data for all configured AppZones in your organization.
The AppZones page provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View a summary of AppZone data in your organization.
- View, monitor, and analyze AppZone data for a single workload.
- Take appropriate actions based on the AppZone data displayed.
- Discover insights about collective AppZone data.
