To edit a privileged credentials policy rule:
- Go to **Policy** > **Privileged Policy** > **Privileged Credentials Policies**.
- Locate the privileged credential policy rule you want to modify and click the **Edit** icon.
The **Edit Privileged Credentials Policy** window appears.
If you only want to change a privileged credentials policy rule's place in the Rule Order, you can manually enter a new value on the [Privileged Credentials Policy](/zpa/about-privileged-credentials-policy) page.
- In the** Edit Privileged Credentials Policy** window, modify fields as necessary. For more information about each field, see [Configuring Privileged Credentials Policies](/zpa/configuring-privileged-credentials-policies).
