Resource groups are the key factor in [configuring Microsegmentation policies](/zpa/configuring-microsegmentation-policies). Admins can create resource groups based on a [combination of the resources](/zpa/about-resources) added to them and a mix of dynamic criteria, including hosts, environments, and cloud tag data. To learn more, see [About Resources](/zpa/about-resources).
The Resource Groups page provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- View a summary of resource group data in your organization.
- Configure, edit, and delete resource groups.
- Take appropriate actions based on the resource group data displayed.
- Discover insights about collective resource group data.
