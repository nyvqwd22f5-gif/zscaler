Once a App Connector is scheduled for an update you can't [change the periodic software update time](/zpa/how-do-i-schedule-periodic-software-update-connector-group) for that particular App Connector. However, you can update the App Connector's software manually.
To manually update software for a App Connector:
- Go to **Configuration & Control** > **Private Infrastructure** > **App Connector Management** > **App Connectors**.
- In the table, locate the App Connector you want to update.
- In the **Update Status** column, verify that the status is **Scheduled**. If the status is not **Scheduled**, then you can't manually update the App Connector.
- Click the **Update Now** icon.
