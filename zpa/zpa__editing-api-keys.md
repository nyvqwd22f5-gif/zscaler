To edit an API key:
-
Go to **Configuration & Control **> **Public API** > **API Keys**.
If you are subscribed to ZIdentity and have it enabled for your tenant, API keys created in the ZIdentity Admin Portal appear on the API Keys page in the ZPA Admin Portal and are read-only. To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
-
In the table, locate the key you want to modify and click the **Edit** icon.
The **Edit API Keys **window appears.
- In the **Edit API Key **window, modify fields as necessary. To learn more about each field, see [Adding an API Key](/zpa/adding-api-key).
