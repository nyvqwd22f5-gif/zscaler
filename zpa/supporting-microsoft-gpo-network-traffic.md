Microsoft Group Policy Object (GPO) network traffic is supported in ZPA. No additional configuration steps are required to support this. Zscaler recommends optimizing GPO performance in your environment if you are using client-to-server network traffic. To learn more about GPO optimization and "Understanding Group Policy Processing" in particular, refer the [Microsoft TechNet article](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.01.gpperf.aspx).
