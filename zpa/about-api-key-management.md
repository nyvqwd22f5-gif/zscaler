Zscaler Client Connector gives you programmatic access through APIs to manage Zscaler Client Connector features. An API key is required to access the publicly available set of Zscaler Client Connector APIs. An API key consists of a client ID and a client secret. Both are required for authentication prior to accessing a publicly available set of Zscaler Client Connector APIs.
Generating an API key only occurs in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal from the Public API page. Client IDs are always accessible from the page. Client secrets are only displayed when the key is first created, and they are not available in the saved configuration.
API keys provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Authenticate and access the Zscaler Client Connector APIs.
- Generate the client ID and client secret used to access the Zscaler Client Connector APIs.
If you need to obtain API keys or secrets to access [Zscaler OneAPI ](/oneapi)endpoints, see [About API Clients](/zidentity/about-api-clients) in ZIdentity.
