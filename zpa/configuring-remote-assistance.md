At times, Zscaler Support engineers might need access to your organization's ZPA Admin Portal for a limited period to troubleshoot issues. Using remote assistance, you can allow Zscaler Support engineers to securely and remotely log in to your Admin Portal. You do not need to create new admin accounts or share passwords to enable access.
To enable remote assistance:
- Log in to the ZPA Admin Portal.
- Go to **Tools** > **Remote Assistance**.
The **Remote Assistance** window appears.
- In the **Remote Assistance** window:
- Select **All **to enable read-only admin access for Zscaler Support engineers.
- Select **None **to disable read-only admin access for Zscaler Support engineers.
