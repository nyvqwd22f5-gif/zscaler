Zscaler is committed to complying with all applicable economic and trade sanctions. Zscaler provides cybersecurity services in compliance with applicable laws and does not provide services to Russian-owned entities.
The United States Government has continued to expand prohibitions on providing services within and to Russia. Due to the increase in restrictions by the United States Government and in order to align with U.S. policy goals, Zscaler is requiring customers to complete an End User Statement in order to receive Zscaler services in Russia.
Submitting a Zscaler End User Statement Form
In order to receive Zscaler services in Russia, you must read and sign the [Zscaler End User Statement form](https://powerforms.docusign.net/781308bd-b65f-474b-9556-c3cffebc9f2b?env=na3&acct=1332b593-c312-4596-8861-f0122ba1543a&accountId=1332b593-c312-4596-8861-f0122ba1543a). You can also download, sign, and return the form via email to exportcompliance@zscaler.com. The form must be signed by an authorized signatory representing your company or organization.
After Zscaler receives and approves your signed form, we will provide instructions on how to continue to use our services in Russia.
If you have any questions about the End User Statement, send an email to exportcompliance@zscaler.com. If you have any questions regarding technical deployment, send an email to z-ask-russia@zscaler.com.
