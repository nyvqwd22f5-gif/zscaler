You can create an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) that your users must accept before they can connect to a [user portal](/zpa/user-portal) and a [Privileged Remote Access (PRA) Portal](/zpa/accessing-privileged-remote-access-portal).
An AUP provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Connect to a user portal and PRA Portal to provide visibility to authorized applications for your organization’s employees and partners.
- Create a user portal and PRA Portal AUP.
To configure an AUP for a user portal and PRA Portal:
- Go to **Configuration & Control** > **Administration Control** > **Acceptable Use Policy**.
- On the **Acceptable Use Policy** page:
- **Frequency**: Select how often the user portal and PRA Portal display the AUP (i.e., **Once** or **Never**).
- **Display Text**: Enter or copy and paste your organization's AUP into the field. Zscaler supports Markdown format.
- Under **Support Information**, enter the **Email **and **Phone Number** for your organization's support team.
- (Optional) Click **Preview **to view the AUP that users see when they initially access a user portal and PRA Portal.
- Click **Save**.
