Branch Connector groups represent a cluster of individual [Branch Connectors](/zpa/about-branch-connectors) used to configure policy rules in the ZPA Admin Portal.
Branch Connector groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Apply policies to a group of Branch Connectors.
- Upgrade Branch Connectors belonging to a group to maintain redundancy while upgrades are being executed.
Branch Connector groups listed in the ZPA Admin Portal come from the [Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal](/cloud-branch-connector/accessing-navigating-zscaler-cloud-branch-connector-admin-portal). You can create Branch Connector groups in the Zscaler Cloud & Branch Connector Admin Portal using the images shared for your hypervisor. To learn more, see [Downloading Branch Connector Images](/cloud-branch-connector/brnch/downloading-branch-connector-images) and [About Branch Connector Groups](/cloud-branch-connector/brnch/about-branch-connector-groups) in the Zscaler Cloud Connector Help Portal.

- Hide the filters on the page by clicking **Hide Filters**. Click **Show Filters** to display the filters.
- Refresh the Branch Connector Groups page to reflect the most current information.
- Filter the Branch Connector group information that appears in the table. By default, no filters are applied. You can also save applied filters to your preferences so that they're visible in future user sessions. To learn more, see [Using Tables](/zpa/using-tables#filterData).
