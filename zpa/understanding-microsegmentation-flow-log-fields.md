The Log Streaming Service (LSS) can send Microsegmentation network flow log information to any third-party log analytics tool. By default, the Microsegmentation network flow log type includes the fields listed in the following table for each log template (i.e., CSV, JSON, TSV). While configuring your log receiver, you can edit the default log stream content to capture only specific fields, and create a custom log template.

The following table includes descriptions and supported field format specifications for each field within the template. To learn more about the format specifications listed for each field, including examples, see [Log Field Format Specifications](/zpa/understanding-log-stream-content-format).

| ----- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| LogTimestamp | Timestamp when the log was generated | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
| Customer | The customer name | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
| AgentID | The Microsegmentation agent ID (192-bit string) | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
| AgentName | The Microsegmentation agent name | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
| ResourceID | The resource ID associated with the agent generating the flow log (192-bit string) | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
| ResourceName | The resource name associated with the agent generating the flow log | %[OPT]s%[OPT]j |
