Usage Insights provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Present usage patterns of the application across an organization.
- Analyze granular details of usage patterns based on segment groups, user groups, and users.
- Review usage patterns to design better access policy rules.
- Download reports of private application usage on a quarterly cadence.
