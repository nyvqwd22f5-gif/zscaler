The Partner Information page is only accessible from ZPA accounts that are designated as Partner accounts.
By default, the [Submit a Ticket](/zpa/accessing-and-navigating-zpa-admin-portal#Tools) feature redirects you to the ZPA Support Portal where you can submit help request tickets to Zscaler Support. However, you can change the URL to one applicable to your organization.
To update the Customer Help Portal URL:
- Go to **Configuration & Control** > **Administration Control **> **Partner Information**.
-
Under **Customer Help Portal**, enter the full URL into the text field. You must include `http://` or `https://` in the URL (e.g., `https://support.mycompany.com`).

- Click **Save**.
To revert back to the default Zscaler Support URL, click **Reset to Default URL**, then click **Confirm **in the confirmation window that appears.
