If you have the[ PRA File Transfer System](/zpa/about-pra-file-system), you can upload files from your system directly to the Privileged Remote Access (PRA) cloud using the PRA Portal where you can manage your uploaded files. After you have uploaded files to the PRA File System, you can then transfer those files to a privileged console.
If you don't have the PRA File Transfer System, you can upload and download files from a privileged console. To learn more, see [Uploading and Downloading with File Transfer](/zpa/uploading-and-downloading-file-transfer).
