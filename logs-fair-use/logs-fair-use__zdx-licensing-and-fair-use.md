Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to a number of seats purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *seat *is a subscription license for the ZDX service for an individual authorized user. The number of seats required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of ZDX over the previous rolling 90-day period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats. If additional seats are needed during a subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats that use the service to ensure license compliance.
You should deploy ZDX for the number of licenses ordered using selective entitlement. You do not have to deploy ZDX for all available Zscaler Client Connector users. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of ZDX deployed users, and can work with you to purchase additional licenses as needed, based on usage.
The usage of ZDX is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
