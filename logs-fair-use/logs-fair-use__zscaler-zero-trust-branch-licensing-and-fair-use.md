Zscaler Zero Trust Branch is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed by the number of appliances enabled for protected devices during the subscription term.
A *device* is defined as an endpoint such as a printer, camera, badge reader, RF scanner, IoT, IIoT, IoMT, server, desktop instance, or other items that have a unique IP address.
The number of appliances enabled for segmentation is determined by counting the number of installed appliances for each of the protected devices and applying the number to the subscription term.
Ensure that you order the correct number of appliances. If additional appliances are needed during a subscription term, refer to Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler monitors and periodically reviews the number of appliances to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Zero Trust Branch is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
