Zscaler Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to the number of data stores purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *data store* is a subscription for a single cloud service instance such as virtual machines (VMs), storage buckets, or databases that your organization utilizes in your public cloud environments.
The number of data stores required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual VMs (every instance is counted as one data store), storage buckets, databases, and any additional supported service that was configured as a scanned service by the customer over the subscription period.
An average volume cap for scanned data is considered as part of the fair use policy. If you exceed that average volume cap, additional volume add-on is required.
Ensure that you order the correct number of data stores. If additional data stores are needed during a subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of data stores that the service monitors to ensure license compliance.
You should deploy DSPM for the number of licenses ordered using selective account onboarding. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of monitored data stores and can work with you to purchase additional licenses as needed, based on usage.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of DSPM is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy). The average volume of scanned data per data store is expected to be less than two times the observed average across Zscaler customers (currently 1TB per data store).
On average, across all subscribed data stores, the volume of scanned data should not exceed 1TB per data store. The volume of some data stores can exceed 1TB, provided that the average volume when calculated across all subscribed data stores remains below 1TB.
If the usage exceeds the acceptable amount, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
