Zscaler Business Insights is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product licensed according to the number of seats purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *seat *is a subscription license for the Business Insights service for an individual authorized user for which Business Insights is tracking SaaS license usage. The number of seats required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of Business Insights over the previous rolling 90-day period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats. If you require additional seats during the subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Business Insights is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
