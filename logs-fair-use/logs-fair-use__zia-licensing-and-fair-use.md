Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that can be licensed in various ways. This article includes information on licensing types, license renewal process, and Zscaler’s Fair Use Policy.
License Types
Zscaler offers the following types of licenses:
- Seat: A subscription license for an individual authorized user. The number of seats required for ZIA is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of ZIA over the previous rolling 90-day period. The total endpoints across all seats may not exceed three times the number of seats purchased.
- Site: A subscription license for a site or location that enables Zero Trust SD-WAN and/or Internet of Things (IoT) device visibility. For an IoT site, only the parent location is counted. In the case of an IoT hub-and-spoke deployment, the spokes or branches behind the hub are each counted as a site. Each site includes a specific number of devices based on the site subscription type.
- ZIA Monthly Traffic: The total amount of Authenticated Traffic and Unauthenticated Traffic that is uploaded and downloaded via ZIA in a calendar month, measured in GB. For these purposes, *Authenticated Traffic* means traffic sent and received by a known seat. *Unauthenticated Traffic* means traffic not related to a known seat, including inline guest Wi-Fi, device, server, and workload traffic.
- Workload: For subscriptions licensed per workload (instead of per GB of Monthly Traffic), including but not limited to Zscaler Workload Communications, a *workload* is defined as a unique domain name, an IP address, or a set of IP addresses. A workload can be virtual machines (VMs), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), serverless functions, and container-based resources deployed in customer public cloud and data center environments.
- Data Center: For subscriptions licensed per data center, such as Zscaler Managed Dedicated IP, a *data center* is defined as a Zscaler data center with which the pair of IP addresses subscribed to by you are associated. The same pair of IP addresses cannot be transferred to a different data center during the lifetime of the subscription.
Zero Trust Browser (Isolation or Cloud Browser Isolation) and Source IP Anchoring (SIPA) are subscribed per seat with a maximum aggregate amount of ZIA Monthly Traffic across all seats.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats, sites, workloads, or amount of monthly traffic. If you require additional seats, sites, workloads, or monthly traffic, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats, sites, workloads, and amount of monthly traffic to ensure license compliance.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of ZIA is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for ZIA is the average ZIA Monthly Traffic across all seats purchased should be less than two times the cloud-wide average (currently 8 GB per seat per month) plus any additional bandwidth entitlement you have. Unauthenticated traffic in excess of this Fair Use Policy requires a subscription for additional bandwidth. Contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
