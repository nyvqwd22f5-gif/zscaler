Zscaler Zero Trust Gateway is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed in various ways. This article includes information on licensing types, the license renewal process, and Zscaler’s Fair Use Policy.
License Types
Zscaler offers the following two types of licenses:
- Monthly Traffic: The total amount of workload traffic that is uploaded and downloaded via the Zero Trust Gateway in a calendar month. The monthly traffic is measured in gigabytes (GB) and is subscribed accordingly. The monthly traffic component also includes entitlement to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) platforms for workloads. For every 1 GB of ZIA and ZPA egress traffic, you receive an additional 10 GB total for Layer-4 policy enforcement for east-west and ingress traffic flows.
- Gateway Instance: A subscription license for Zero Trust Gateway instances. Each gateway instance license provides entitlement to a Zero Trust Gateway instance in an Availability Zone in any Amazon Web Services (AWS) region. A minimum of two gateway instances is needed to use a gateway in an AWS region.
Ensure that you order the correct amount of monthly traffic and gateway instances. If you require additional monthly traffic or gateway instances, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the amount of monthly traffic and gateway instances to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Zero Trust Gateway is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
