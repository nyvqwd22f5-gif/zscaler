Zscaler Network Observability is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that can be licensed in various ways. This article includes information on licensing types, the license renewal process, and Zscaler’s Fair Use Policy.
License Types
Zscaler offers the following two types of licenses:
- Device: A subscription license for a monitored device. The number of devices is determined by counting the total number of unique IP addresses configured for Network Observability over the subscription period.
- Metrics: A subscription for the number of monitored metrics. The number of metrics that can be collected from each device is determined by the type of networking device. The full list for each device type is described in the documentation.
Ensure that you order the correct number of devices or metrics to be monitored. If additional devices or metrics to be monitored are needed during a subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of devices and metrics to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Zscaler Network Observability is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
