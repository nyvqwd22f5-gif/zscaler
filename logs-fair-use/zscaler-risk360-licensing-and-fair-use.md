Zscaler Risk360 is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to the number of seats purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *seat* is a subscription license for the Risk360 service for an individual authorized user. The number of licenses required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of ZIA over the previous rolling 90-day period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats. If you require additional seats during a subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats that use the service to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Risk360 is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
