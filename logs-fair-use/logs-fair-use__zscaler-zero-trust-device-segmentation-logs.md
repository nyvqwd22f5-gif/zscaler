By accessing the Zscaler Zero Trust Device Segmentation (formerly Airgap) service, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs. For Device Segmentation, logs are defined as Session Logs and Audit Logs.
- Session Logs: Traffic flow of information related to the sessions originating from endpoints connected to the Zscaler segmentation network.
- Audit Logs: Activity logs of the configuration changes made in the Device Segmentation Admin Portal or API.
Zscaler retains log information for a rolling period of six months during your subscription. When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler after the six-month retention cycle.
During the deployment process, you can choose to have the logs stored in either the United States or the European Union.
