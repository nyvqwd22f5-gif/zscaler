Zscaler Posture Control (ZPC) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to the number of workloads purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *workload* is a subscription for a single cloud workload such as virtual machines (VMs), serverless functions, and container resources that your organization utilizes in your public cloud environments.
The number of workloads required is determined by counting the unique individual VMs (every VM is counted as one workload), serverless functions (every 5 serverless functions count as one workload), and containers (every 5 containers count as one workload) over the subscription period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of workloads. If additional workloads are needed during a subscription term, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of workloads that the service monitors to ensure license compliance.
You should deploy ZPC for the number of licenses ordered using selective account onboarding. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of monitored workloads and can work with you to purchase additional licenses as needed, based on usage.
The usage of ZPC is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
