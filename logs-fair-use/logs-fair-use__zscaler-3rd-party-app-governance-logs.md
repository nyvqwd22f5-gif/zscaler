By accessing the 3rd-Party App Governance (formerly AppTotal) service, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs.
Logs capture user and application activity metadata for your SaaS applications and for third party SaaS application integrations. Logs are retained by Zscaler for a rolling period of six months during the term of subscription. When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler after the six month retention cycle. Logs are stored in the United States.
