By accessing ZIdentity, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs. For ZIdentity,* logs* are defined as follows:
- Audit Logs: Activity records of configuration and authentication changes made in the ZIdentity Admin Portal and with the administrative API. To learn more, see [About Audit Logs](/zslogin/about-audit-logs).
Zscaler retains audit log information for a rolling period of six months during the subscription term. When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler according to the applicable retention period.
During the deployment process, you can choose to have the logs stored in either the United States or the European Union.
