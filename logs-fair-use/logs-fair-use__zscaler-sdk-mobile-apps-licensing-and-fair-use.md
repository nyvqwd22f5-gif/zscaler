Zscaler SDK for Mobile Apps (ZSDK) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed based on the number of Monthly Active Users (MAUs) for a given client mobile app for the subscription term in an order.
An *active user* is defined as an individual authorized user that logs into the client mobile app at least once during a calendar month. The number of MAUs required is determined by counting the total number of unique monthly active users over the previous rolling 90-day period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of MAUs. If you require additional MAUs, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of MAUs to ensure license compliance.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of ZSDK is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for ZSDK is that the average monthly traffic per client mobile app is expected to be less than 950 TB. If the usage exceeds the acceptable amount, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
