In order to provide the Zscaler Breach Predictor service, Zscaler has the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs as defined in this article.
For Breach Predictor, logs are defined as the duplicates of the configuration and transaction data collected via logs from other Zscaler SaaS products, such as Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) or Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), that Zscaler uses to identify suspicious and potentially malicious threat patterns for the customer.
For the Breach Predictor AI Assist feature, prompts and responses are stored by Zscaler for 30 days as part of the session history. Breach Predictor AI Assist is not trained using any customer data.
Zscaler retains Breach Predictor logs for a rolling period of up to a year during your subscription term, depending on your subscription's SKU. When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler according to applicable retention cycles.
During the deployment process, you can choose to have the logs stored in either the European Union or India.
