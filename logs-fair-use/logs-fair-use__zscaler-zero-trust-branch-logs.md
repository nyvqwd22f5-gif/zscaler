By accessing the Zscaler Zero Trust Branch service, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs. For Zero Trust Branch, *logs* are defined as Session Logs and Audit Logs.
- Session Logs: Traffic flow of information related to the sessions originating from endpoints connected to the Zscaler segmentation network.
- Audit Logs: Activity logs of the configuration changes made in the Zero Trust Branch Admin Portal or API.
Zscaler retains Session Logs for a rolling period of seven days during your subscription term. Zscaler retains Audit Logs for a rolling period of six months during your subscription term. When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler according to applicable retention cycles.
During the deployment process, you can choose to have the logs stored in either the United States or the European Union.
