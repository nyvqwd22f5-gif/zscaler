By accessing the Zscaler Adaptive Access Engine service, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs. For Adaptive Access Engine, *logs* are defined as follows:
- Signal History: Security context signals received from Zscaler products such as Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and third-party security products that typically indicate a level of risk for a user or device.
- Audit Logs: Activity records of configuration changes made in the Admin Portal and via the Adaptive Access Engine API.
Zscaler retains the Signal History for a rolling period of 90 days during the term of the subscription. Zscaler retains Audit Log information for a rolling period of 6 months during the subscription term.
When the subscription term ends or expires, the logs are deleted by Zscaler according to the applicable retention cycles.
