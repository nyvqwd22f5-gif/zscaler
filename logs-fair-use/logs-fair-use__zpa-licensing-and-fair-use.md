Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed in various ways. This article includes information on licensing types, the license renewal process, and Zscaler’s Fair Use Policy.
License Types
Zscaler offers the following types of licenses:
- Seat: A subscription license for an individual authorized user. The number of seats required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of ZPA over the previous rolling 90-day period.
- Site: A subscription license for a site or location that enables Zero Trust SD-WAN. Each site includes a specific number of devices based on the site subscription type.
- ZPA Monthly Traffic: The total amount of traffic that is uploaded and downloaded via ZPA in a calendar month, measured in GB.
- System: Each system is equivalent to an RDP, SSH, VNC or RealVNC target that enables Privileged Remote Access (PRA).
- Workload: For subscriptions licensed per workload (instead of per GB of monthly traffic), including but not limited to Zscaler Workload Communications, a *workload* is defined as a unique domain name, an IP address, or a set of IP addresses. A workload can be virtual machines (VMs), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), serverless functions, and container-based resources deployed in your public cloud and data center environments.
Browser Isolation (Isolation) and Source IP Anchoring (SIPA) are subscribed per seat with a maximum aggregate amount of ZPA Monthly Traffic across all seats.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats, sites, workloads, or amount of monthly traffic. If you require additional seats, sites, workloads, or monthly traffic, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats, sites, workloads, and amount of monthly traffic to ensure license compliance.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of ZPA is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for ZPA is the average monthly traffic across all seats purchased should be less than two times the cloud-wide average (currently 3 GB per seat per month) plus any additional bandwidth entitlement you have. Use of ZPA monthly traffic in excess of this Fair Use Policy requires a subscription for additional entitlements. Contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
