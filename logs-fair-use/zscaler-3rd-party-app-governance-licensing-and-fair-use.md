Zscaler 3rd-Party App Governance (formerly AppTotal) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to the number of seats purchased for the subscription term in an order. A *seat* is a subscription to the 3rd-Party App Governance SaaS for an individual authorized user. The number of seats required is determined by counting the total number of unique users accessing and/or using the SaaS over the previous rolling 90-day period.
Ensure that you order the correct number of seats. If you require additional seats, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats to ensure license compliance.

The usage of 3rd-Party App Governance is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for 3rd-Party App Governance is the average data transfer per subscribed seat should be less than two times the cloud-wide average (currently 6 GB per seat per month). Usage exceeding the Fair Use Policy requires a subscription for additional entitlements. Contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
