Cloud configuration data, Cloud Service Provider (CSP) activity audit logs, and cloud user directory information are processed by Zscaler in connection with your organization's use of Zscaler Data Security Posture Management (DSPM).
In addition, subject to customer configuration and enablement, the following logs are also processed:
- Data residing in cloud data stores such as databases, storage services and data volumes (disks) is scanned and classified. Raw data is not saved, only static metadata is stored and reported.
- CSP-hosted virtual machines operating system drive is scanned for installed packages and vulnerabilities (CVEs).
All logs that describe active cloud resources or issues are retained by Zscaler for the duration of the subscription. Once the resources are no longer present in the CSP, DSPM maintains the logs for a rolling period of 180 days during the term of the subscription. When the subscription term ends or expires, Zscaler deletes the logs after the 180-day retention cycle or earlier upon request. By accessing the DSPM service, you provide Zscaler the right to process, use, reproduce, store, modify, and display the information from logs.
During the deployment process, you can choose to have the logs stored in either the United States or the European Union.
