Zscaler Unified Vulnerability Management (UVM) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed according to the number of assets purchased for the subscription term in an order. The number of assets is counted as the total number of assets processed and stored in UVM.
Ensure that you order the correct number of assets. If you require additional assets, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of seats, sites, workloads, and amount of monthly traffic to ensure license compliance.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of UVM is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for UVM is:
- The average data processing (uncompressed) is expected to be no more than 3MB per asset on a daily basis.
- The average number of daily queries per account is expected to be no more than 4K queries per day.
If the usage exceeds the acceptable amount, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
