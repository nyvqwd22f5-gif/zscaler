Zscaler Zero Trust Device Segmentation (formerly Airgap) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) product that is licensed by the number of gateways enabled for protected devices during the subscription term.
License Types
Zscaler offers the following two types of licenses:
- Device: A subscription license for an endpoint such as a printer, camera, badge reader, RF scanner, IoT, IIoT, IoMT, server, desktop instance, or other items that have a unique IP address.
- Gateway: A subscription license for a piece of hardware or virtual machine sitting between different networks or applications
The number of gateways enabled for segmentation is determined by counting the number of installed gateways for each of the protected devices and applying the number to the subscription term. You may purchase additional entitlements allowing the addition of additional devices to a gateway.
Ensure that you order the correct number of gateways and devices. If additional gateways or devices are needed during a subscription term, refer to Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler monitors and periodically reviews the number of gateways and devices to ensure license compliance.
The usage of Zero Trust Device Segmentation is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy).
