License Types
Zscaler offers the following two types of licenses:
- Seat: A subscription license for the Zscaler EASM service for an individual authorized user. The number of seats required is determined by counting the total number of unique individual users of Zscaler EASM over the previous rolling 90-day period.
- Asset: A subscription license for the number of unique public internet-facing corporate assets discovered by EASM such as:
- Domains
- Hosts
- Web pages

Ensure that you order the correct number of seats or assets. If you require additional seats or assets, contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner. Zscaler periodically reviews the number of users and assets to ensure license compliance.
Fair Use Policy
The usage of EASM is expected to be in accordance with the [Acceptable Use Policy](/legal/acceptable-use-policy). The Fair Use Policy for EASM is that under the seat license type, the asset to seat ratio may not exceed 0.75. Usage exceeding the Fair Use Policy requires a subscription for additional entitlements. Contact Zscaler Sales or your Channel Partner to discuss available options.
