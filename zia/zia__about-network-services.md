Zscaler Firewall allows you to manage a wide variety of network services by configuring firewall policies to allow or block specific services. Zscaler provides over 50 predefined network services along with the TCP and UDP ports (for source and destination) over which these services typically operate. These predefined network services can be readily configured as rule conditions and managed using firewall policies. In addition to the predefined services, you can add up to 832 custom network services and control them using policies. Additionally, you can customize the ports assigned to the predefined network services by adding new ports and modifying and deleting existing ones. To learn more, see [Modifying Predefined Network Services](/zia/modifying-predefined-network-services).
[List of Predefined Network Services](#list)
The following predefined network services are view-only and cannot be modified: ESP, GRE, ICMP, TCP, UDP, and Zscaler Proxy Network Services (includes all Zscaler-specific web proxy ports including customer-specific [Dedicated Proxy Ports](/zia/configuring-dedicated-proxy-ports)).
Network services provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure 5-tuple Firewall Filtering rules, NAT rules, IPS Control rules, and Forwarding rules based on network services that include specific source or destination ports and protocols and enforce condition-based actions to allow, block, or redirect your network traffic.
- Customize the port and protocol configurations in predefined network services and create additional custom network services per requirements.
- [Group network services](/zia/configuring-network-service-groups) and use them as conditions in security policies to control your network traffic.
Network services configured in Zscaler are identified at the first packet, leading to immediate policy action. In contrast, multiple packets are typically required by deep packet inspection to identify network applications before a policy action can take place. Therefore, Zscaler recommends that you rank Firewall Filtering rules for network services higher than rules for network applications to prevent packets from being allowed unnecessarily from traffic that would otherwise be blocked by rules using first-packet identification. To learn more, see [About Network Applications](/zia/about-network-applications).
