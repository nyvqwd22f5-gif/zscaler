The Zscaler Management Portal for Partners is used by Zscaler partners so that they can manage their provisioned customers and tenants. These provisioned customers and tenants can cross different Zscaler clouds.
A Zscaler partner can have multiple customers, and each customer might have multiple tenant organizations linked under them. Through the Management Portal, a partner can view this hierarchy from their partner account. The Management Portal provides a single interface for partners to get a complete view of their customers and tenants.
