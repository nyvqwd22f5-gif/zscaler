Zscaler's Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) uses a virtual machine (VM) to stream traffic logs from the [Nanolog](/zia/about-zscaler-cloud-architecture) to your security information and event management (SIEM) system, enabling real-time alerting, correlation with the logs of your other devices, and long-term local log archival. To learn more, see [Understanding Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS)](/zia/understanding-nanolog-streaming-service).
