You can create user-related [widgets](/zia/what-widget) in the dashboard and [reports](/zia/about-interactive-reports) or when [analyzing charts](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights) in **Web**, **Mobile**, **Firewall**, or **DNS** **Insights**. For example, you can create a report to view and export a list of users who browse the web the most.
Excluding locations also applies to the **Executive Report** and all standard, user-related reports in **Interactive Reports**.
Excluding Locations in Widgets
By default, user-related widgets include locations and users. You can exclude locations by creating new or editing existing widgets and using the **Exclude Location** filter. This filter applies to all user-related widgets except for widgets in the default **Security **dashboard.
For example, if you edit the user-related widget **Top Users **in the Web Overview dashboard, choose the filter** User** and enable the **Exclude Location** toggle. [See image.](#edit-exclude-locations)
When adding a new widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports):
