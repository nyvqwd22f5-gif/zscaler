The Zscaler service supports the following languages for [end user notifications](/zia/about-acceptable-use-policy-and-end-user-notifications) (EUNs):
- English
- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese
- Dutch
- French
- German
- Japanese
- Brazilian Portuguese
- European Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Spanish (Latin America)
- Italian
- Indonesian
- Korean
- Turkish
- Thai
- Vietnamese
To have users view EUNs in one of these languages, ensure that the language setting in your users' browser is set to that language. The Zscaler service automatically detects the browser language setting and displays EUNs in that language. See the browser documentation for instructions on changing the language setting of that browser. If you configure your browser to display a language the service doesn't support, the service displays the EUNs in English.
If you redirect users to an external site that hosts EUNs, keep in mind that those pages are global for the entire organization. Therefore, to enable your non-English speaking users to view EUNs in a specific language, ensure that your external site has browser language detection enabled.
The Zscaler service only displays the Authentication dialog box in English. When configuring the [Acceptable Use Policy](/zia/configuring-acceptable-use-policy) notification, you can create a message containing multiple languages, because it's a free-form text field. However, a browser language check won't take place.
