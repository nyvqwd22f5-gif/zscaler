The Industry Peer Comparison Report compares your organization's performance and effectiveness for the preceding month to that of both peer organizations and all companies using our cloud service. Peers are chosen based on business vertical, geographic region, and business size.
The report is broken down by overall traffic, threats by category, recreational applications, and productivity applications.
You can view your report in the ZIA Admin Portal by going to **Analytics **> **Industry Peer Comparison**.
