Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision [users](/zia/about-users), [groups](/zia/about-groups), and departments as described in [About Provisioning and Authentication Methods](/zia/choosing-provisioning-and-authentication-methods). You can also add departments when you configure policies. This article describes how to add a department on the Departments page in the ZIA Admin Portal.
You can use a [CSV file to add multiple departments](/zia/about-departments#import-multiple-departments) at once.
To add a new department:
- Go to **Administration **>** User Management**.
- Click the** Departments **tab.
- Click **Add Department**.
The **Add Department** window appears.
- In the **Add Department** window:
- **Department Name**: Enter a** **department name.
- **Comments**: Optionally, enter additional notes or information. The content cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
- Click **Save** and [activate the change](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
After creating the department, you can [add users](/zia/adding-users) to it.
