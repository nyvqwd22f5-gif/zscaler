The Watermarking page lets you add, view, and configure watermark profiles to enforce rights management for your organization. You can use watermarks as part of your SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy to superimpose text diagonally across pages and images so that content you want to protect can be clearly and easily identified. In addition to watermark text, the Zscaler service lets you add headers and footers to protected files.
When configuring SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning DLP policy rules, you can use the watermark profiles you create to add watermark content to multiple file types. To learn more, see [Adding and Editing Watermark Profiles](/zia/adding-editing-watermark-profiles).
The Watermarking page provides the following benefits and allows you to:
- Add, view, and configure watermark profiles for your organization.
- Make watermarks available to be used on multiple file types as part of your SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning DLP policy.
