# Configuring Multiple Locations and Sublocations
Source: https://help.zscaler.com/zia/configuring-multiple-locations-and-sublocations
PDF: https://help.zscaler.com/pdf/com/en/1399276.pdf

To add or delete multiple locations in the ZIA Admin Portal, you can import a CSV file. You can also use a CSV file to add or delete the following features to existing locations:
- Sublocations
- IP addresses
- VPN information
- Dedicated proxy port numbers
- Virtual Service Edges
- Virtual Service Edge clusters
In the ZIA Admin Portal, you can download a sample file which shows the correct CSV format for adding and deleting locations or location features.
To download the sample file:
- Go to **Administration** >** Location Management**.
-
Click **Sample Import CSV File**.
You can click **Download CSV **to download a CSV file that displays your currently configured locations, but you cannot use this file for adding and deleting additional locations or location features. You must create a new CSV file.
![The Download CSV and Sample Import CSV File options on the Locations page of the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) Admin Portal](/downloads/zia/documentation-knowledgebase/traffic-forwarding/locations/configuring-multiple-locations-and-sub-locations/Configuring-Multiple-Locations-Sublocations-Download-CSV.png)
The information below details how to correctly format your CSV file when adding and deleting locations, or adding and deleting features for existing locations. If you try to import a CSV file that does not use the correct format, an error message appears. To learn more, see [Importing Location and Sublocation Information from a CSV File](/zia/importing-locations-using-a-csv).
Formatting CSV Files
This section provides the template and sample entries for the required field values when you use a CSV file to add or delete locations, sublocations, or location features. The field values are listed in the order in which you must enter them. All required fields, including fields that are required only under certain conditions, are also specified. You must place a comma between each field value. Spaces between commas are not required, but you can add them if you prefer. If a field is not required, and you do not want to enter a value for the field, you must leave the field blank to indicate to the service that you are skipping over this value. For example, if you are skipping over the Time Zone value, add an additional comma after the Country value before entering the Auth-Enable value:
+, Location, locationName1, 10.10.100.242, California, United States,, Auth-Enable...
The values are not case-sensitive.
You can use one CSV file to add or delete multiple types of information. For example, in one CSV file, you can have several lines for adding or deleting multiple locations, immediately followed by several lines adding or deleting sublocations for either those locations or other existing locations, followed by several lines adding or deleting ports for those locations or other existing locations. To learn more about formatting CSV files for adding locations and other location features, see the sections below:

The following fields are required for adding or deleting locations:
- **Add/Delete (Required)**:** **Enter + or - to indicate whether you want to add or delete a location. This field is required.
- **Location (Required)**: Enter the word Location.
- **Location name (Required)**: Enter the name of your location.
- **IP (Required unless you enter a value for Dedicated Port, VPN-Type/VPN-userName, VirtualServiceEdgeCluster, or VirtualServiceEdgeClusterName)**: Enter the public IP address of the location. If you are not entering an IP address, leave the field blank. If you want to add multiple IP addresses to a location, you must enter a new row for each IP address.
- [See example.](#Example)
- **State**: Enter the state for the location. If you do not want to enter a state, or if the location is in a country outside the United States, leave the field blank.
- **Country (Required)**: Enter the country for the location.
- **Time Zone (Required)**: Enter the location time zone. When you specify the location in a policy, the service applies the policy according to the location's time zone. For example, if a Cloud App Control policy blocks posting to Facebook between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, and the rule is applied to locations in Spain and California, users at each location are blocked during their respective daytime hours.
- **Auth-Enable (Required if entering a value in Dedicated Port or if enabling Surrogate IP)**: If you want to require users from this location to authenticate to the Zscaler service, enter `Auth-Enable`. If you do not want to enable authentication (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **XFF-Enable**:** **If this location uses proxy chaining to forward traffic to the service, and you want the service to discover the client RFC 1918 IP address from the XFF headers in HTTP requests and apply appropriate sublocation or user policies, enter `XFF-Enable`. If you do not want to enable this feature (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **Firewall-Enable**: If you want to enable firewall controls at the location, enter `Firewall-Enable`. If you do not want to enable firewall controls (or if you want to disable them for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **Bandwidth-Enable**: If you want to enable bandwidth control for the location, enter `Bandwidth-Enable`. If you do not want to enable bandwidth control (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **Upload (Mbps) (Required if enabling bandwidth control)**: Enter the maximum upload bandwidth limit for the location. If you have not enabled bandwidth control, leave the field blank.
- **Download (Mbps) (Required if enabling bandwidth control)**: Enter the maximum upload bandwidth limit for the location. If you have not enabled bandwidth control, leave the field blank.
- **SurrogateIP-Enable** **(If you enable this feature, Auth must be enabled)**: Enter `SurrogateIP-Enable` to enable Surrogate IP and map users to IP addresses for devices. If you do not want to enable Surrogate IP (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank. To learn more, see [About Surrogate IP](/zia/about-surrogate-ip).
- **Digit-TimeUnit (Required if enabling Surrogate IP)**: If you're enabling Surrogate IP, specify how long after a completed transaction the service retains the IP-address-to-user mapping (e.g., `8Hours`). If you have not enabled Surrogate IP, leave the field blank.
- **VPN-type (Required unless you enter a value for IP, Dedicated port, VirtualServiceEdgeName, or VirtualServiceEdgeClusterName)**: If this location uses an IPSec VPN tunnel to forward traffic to the Zscaler service, enter the VPN type for the location (`IP or FQDN`). If you are not entering a VPN type, leave the field blank.
- **VPN-userName (Required if you enter a VPN-type)**:** **For IP addresses, enter the gateway IP address given to Zscaler beforehand. For Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), enter the FQDN that was given to Zscaler beforehand. If you did not enter a VPN type, leave the field blank.
- **Dedicated Port (Required unless you enter a value for IP or VPN-type/VPN-userName, VirtualServiceEdgeName, or VirtualServiceEdgeClusterName)**: If you are entering a value here, you must also enable Auth. If the location is associated with a dedicated proxy port, enter the port number. If you are not adding a dedicated port, leave the field blank.
- **VirtualServiceEdgeName (Required unless you enter a value for IP, Dedicated Port, VPN-type/VPN-userName, or VirtualServiceEdgeClusterName)**: If the location sends traffic to a Virtual Service Edge, enter a comma (,), then the name of the Virtual Service Edge. The comma is required because this is the place where the service expects to see the parent name for sublocations. You must add the comma to indicate there is no parent location here because this entry is not a sublocation. (A single Virtual Service Edge is used for testing purposes only, and in production environments, Virtual Service Edge clusters must be used.) If you are not adding a Virtual Service Edge, leave the field blank.
- **VirtualServiceEdgeClusterName (Required unless you enter a value for IP, Dedicated Port, VPN-type/VPN-userName, or VirtualServiceEdgeName)**: If the location sends traffic to a Virtual Service Edge cluster, enter the name of the Virtual Service Edge cluster. If you are not adding a Virtual Service Edge cluster, leave the field blank.
- **SurrogateIP-Enforced-KnownBrowsers (If you enable this feature, Surrogate IP must be enabled)**: To enable the Zscaler service to use the existing IP-address-to-user mapping to identify users sending traffic from known browsers, enter `SurrogateIP-Enforced-KnownBrowsers`. If you are not enabling surrogate IP for known browsers (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
-
**SurrogateIP-Refresh Time (Required if you enable SurrogateIP-Enforced-KnownBrowsers)**:** **Specify the length of time that the Zscaler service can use IP-address-to-user mapping for authenticating users sending traffic from known browsers (e.g., `4 Hours`). After the defined period of time elapses, the service refreshes and revalidates the existing IP-address-to-user mapping so that it can continue to use the mapping for authenticating users on browsers. If you have not enabled surrogate IP for known browsers, leave the field blank.
The refresh time for the revalidation of IP surrogacy must be shorter than the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) lease time. Otherwise, the wrong user policies might be applied. Also, Zscaler recommends setting the **SurrogateIP-Refresh Time** to a time period shorter than what you specified for **SurrogateIP-Idle Time**.
- **GRE-Enable**: If you enabled Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunneling for this location, enter the information about the tunnel connected to the ZIA Public Service Edge. GRE tunnels are bound to locations only, not sublocations.
- **AUP-Enable (If you enable this feature, Auth must be disabled)**: If you want to display an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for unauthenticated traffic, and require users to accept it at this location, enter `AUP-Enable`. If you do not want to enable AUP (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **AUP Refresh Time (Required if enabling AUP)**: Specify how frequently, in days, the AUP is displayed to users.
-
**Managed By**: Enter the name of the partner that is managing the location. The valid partner names are:
- Cisco Viptela
- Citrix SD-WAN
- CloudGenix
- HPE Aruba
- ngena
- Riverbed SteelConnect
- Silver Peak
- VMware VeloCloud
If the location is not being managed by a partner, leave the field blank.
- **Group Name**: Enter the [location group](/zia/about-location-groups) name. Any sublocations inherit the group membership from their parent location. If you do not want to add this location to a group, leave the field blank.
- **aupBlockInternetAccess-Enable (If you enable this feature, AUP-Enable must be enabled)**: If you want the Zscaler service to disable all access to the internet, including non-HTTP traffic, until the user accepts the AUP that is displayed to them, enter `aupBlockInternetAccess-Enable`.
- **aupForceSSLInspection-Enable (If you enable this feature, AUP-Enable must be enabled)**: If you want to make [SSL Inspection](/zia/about-ssl-inspection) enforce an AUP for HTTPS traffic, enter `aupForceSSLInspection-Enable`.
- **Caution-Enable (If you enable this feature, Auth must be disabled)**: If you want to display a caution notification to unauthenticated users, enter `Caution-Enable`. If you enable this feature, you must use one of the following methods to forward traffic to the service:
- A [GRE](/zia/configuring-gre-tunnels) or [IPSec](/zia/configuring-ipsec-vpn-tunnel) tunnel without NAT
- Forward [proxy chaining](/zia/configuring-proxy-chaining) with the **XFF-Enable** option turned on for the location
- **IPS-Enable** **(If you enable this feature, firewall controls must be enabled)**:** **If you want to enable Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) controls at the location, enter `IPS-Enable`. If you do not want to enable IPS controls (or if you want to disable them for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **Exclude-Manual-Group**: To prevent the location from being added to manual location groups, enter `Exclude-Manual-Group`. If you want to allow this location to be added to manual groups, leave the field blank.
- **Exclude-Dynamic-Group**: To prevent the location from being assigned to dynamic location groups, enter `Exclude-Dynamic-Group`. If you want to allow this location to be assigned to dynamic groups, leave the field blank.
- **Kerberos-Enable** **(If you enable this feature, Auth must be enabled)**: If you want to enforce Kerberos authentication on all web traffic explicitly forwarded from the location and its associated dedicated ports, enter `Kerberos-Enable`. If you do not want to enable Kerberos authentication (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
- **Digest-Auth-Enable**: To enforce digest authentication on all web traffic explicitly forwarded from this location and its associated dedicated ports, enter `Digest-Auth-Enable`. If you do not want to enable digest authentication (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
-
**Location-Type**: Enter any of the following location types to set it as the primary web traffic for the location:
- `CORPORATE`
- `GUESTWIFI`
- `IOT`
- `SERVER`
This field is required.
- **Description**: (Optional) Enter additional notes or information. The description cannot exceed 1,024 characters.
-
**Basic-Auth-Enable**: To enforce basic authentication on all web traffic explicitly forwarded from this location and its associated dedicated ports, enter `Basic-Auth-Enable`. If you do not want to enable basic authentication (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
The following caveats apply to Basic Authentication:
- The Cloud Service API Security feature must be enabled for your organization.
- The Hosted DB user repository type with the Form-Based authentication type is supported.
- The hosted users/passwords must be created or imported using a CSV file.
- The users must be enrolled for basic authentication using the following APIs:
- `https://admin.``<cloud>``.net/api/v1/authenticatedSession`
- `https://admin.``<cloud>``.net/api/v1/users/<userid>/enroll`
For the authenticatedSession API endpoint, admin user credentials and an API key are required. For the users API endpoint, you can get the user IDs using the browser developer tool on the User Management page.
After the user's enrollment, their credentials are used for basic proxy authentication.
Here is an example of basic proxy authentication:
curl -ivk -x gateway.<cloud>.net:<port> -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0" -U "<username>@<domain.com>:<passwd>" example.com
The user credentials are transferred in clear text when using basic authentication. So, you must use an IPSec tunnel from a router or firewall or an encrypted tunnel from cloud or branch connectors if you are forwarding the authenticated traffic over the public internet.
-
**IoT-Discovery-Enable**: To discover Internet of Things (IoT)/Operational Technology (OT) devices, servers, and unmanaged devices (e.g., personal user devices) at this location, enter `IoT-Discovery-Enable`. If you do not want to enable IoT discovery (or if you want to disable it for an existing location), leave the field blank.
This field is available only if IoT discovery is enabled for your organization.
- **City-GeoId**: Enter the city geolocation ID. This field is required if you enable IoT discovery. If you want to use the latitude and longitude to derive the city geolocation ID, you can leave the field blank and enable the **Geo-Override-Enable** option and enter latitude and longitude.
-
**Geo-Override-Enable**: To override the city geolocation ID with the desired latitude and longitude, enter `Geo-Override-Enable`. If you do not want to enable geo override, leave the field blank.
You can add multiple locations in the same city using this option.
- **Latitude**: Enter the latitude of the city geolocation. This field is required if you enable geo override.
- **Longitude**: Enter the longitude of the city geolocation. This field is required if you enable geo override.
- **CookiesAndProxy-Enable**: To prevent additional authentication challenges to traffic using both cookie- and non-cookie-based authentication methods after the initial challenge, enter `CookiesAndProxy-Enable`.
-
**IoT-Policy-Enable**: To enforce URL Filtering and Cloud App Control policy rules based on IoT machine learning (ML) classifications provided by the Zscaler AI/ML for this location, enter` IoT-Policy-Enable`.
This field is available only if the IoT policy control is enabled for your organization.
