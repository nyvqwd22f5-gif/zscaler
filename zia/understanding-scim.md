SCIM (the System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is a standard protocol that you can use for provisioning and user and group management. Zscaler provides an easy and consistent mechanism for customers to use SCIM to manage the lifecycle of user and group accounts in the Zscaler cloud.
You can use SCIM for:
- Provisioning users and groups onto Zscaler. To learn more about provisioning, see [Choosing Provisioning and Authentication Methods](/zia/choosing-provisioning-and-authentication-methods).
- Automatically updating a user's group and department on the Zscaler user database to reflect changes in your user directory
- Deprovisioning users from Zscaler database when users are deleted from your user directory
There are two ways you can use SCIM with the Zscaler service. Firstly, you can use custom SCIM clients to make REST API calls to Zscaler. To learn more, see [SCIM API Examples](/zia/scim-api-examples). Secondly, you can use one of the IdPs partnered with Zscaler.
For IdP configuration guides, see:
- [SAML & SCIM Configuration Guide for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)](/zia/saml-scim-configuration-example-microsoft-azure-active-directory)
- [SAML & SCIM Configuration Guide for Okta](/zia/saml-scim-configuration-example-okta)
- [SAML & SCIM Configuration Guide for PingFederate](/zia/saml-scim-configuration-guide-pingfederate)
When creating users, the domain included in the username must be preregistered with Zscaler. For example, if a user has the username of "test@safemarch.com", the domain "safemarch.com" needs to be registered to your tenant on Zscaler. Zscaler Support can assist you with the process. In addition, the total number of groups associated with a single user cannot exceed 128.
Zscaler supports only SCIM version 2.0 and SAML must be used as your authentication method to use SCIM for provisioning.
