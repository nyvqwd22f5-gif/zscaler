Zscaler provides secured access to cloud service API, Sandbox Submission API, and 3rd-Party App Governance API using different authentication schemes:
If you need to obtain API keys, authenticate into, and make calls using [Zscaler OneAPI](/oneapi) endpoints, see [API Client Authentication](/zidentity/integration/oneapi-authentication) in ZIdentity and [Getting Started](/oneapi/getting-started) with OneAPI.

| API | Supported Authentication Methods |
| --- | -------------------------------- |
| Cloud Service API | OAuth 2.0 (recommended)Combination of Basic Authentication and API Key |
| Sandbox Submission API | Combination of Basic Authentication and API Token |
| 3rd-Party App Governance API | API Key. Contact Zscaler Support if you do not have a valid API key. |
OAuth 2.0 Authentication
OAuth 2.0 allows third-party applications to obtain controlled access to protected resources using access tokens. Zscaler uses the Client Credentials grant type, in which the clients exchange their credentials for an access token. For more information, see [Securing ZIA APIs with OAuth 2.0](/zia/securing-zia-apis-oauth-2.0).
Zscaler recommends the OAuth 2.0 authentication method for accessing the cloud service API.
Your organization must meet the following prerequisites before you can access the API:
- [Prerequisites for OAuth 2.0 Authentication](#OAuthPrerequisites)
When the prerequisites are met, you can securely access the API in the following way:
- [1. Retrieve your base URL.](#RetrieveBaseURL)
- [2. Authenticate the client and retrieve an access token.](#RetrieveAccessToken)
- [3. Make an API call.](#MakeAPICallUsingOAuth)
- [4. Activate configuration changes.](#ActivateChanges)
To learn more about rate limiting and HTTP status codes, see [Understanding Rate Limiting](/zia/understanding-rate-limiting) and [API Response Codes and Error Messages](/zia/api-response-codes-and-error-messages). If you encounter any issues with the API, contact Zscaler Support.
Using ZIA Admin Credentials and API Key/Token
In this method, API authentication is based on a combination of the API key and ZIA admin credentials (i.e., username and password).
Before getting started, make sure that your organization has an API subscription and an API key/token enabled. If you do not have a valid subscription, submit a Zscaler Support ticket. To learn more, see [Managing Cloud Service API Key](/zia/managing-cloud-service-api-key) and [Managing Sandbox API Token](/zia/managing-sandbox-api-token).
In ZIdentity-enabled tenants, administrators accessing the ZIA APIs must be hosted on ZIdentity with appropriate roles assigned from ZIA. Users provisioned via third-party identity providers (IdPs) cannot authenticate to the APIs.
As a security best practice, it is highly recommended that you create a dedicated admin role and user with restricted functional scope access within the ZIA Admin Portal. This helps ensure correct usage, avoids potential conflicts between API and ZIA Admin Portal logins, and prevents misuse.
When these prerequisites are met, you can securely access the API in the following way:
- [1. Retrieve your base URL and API key/token.](#RetrieveAPIKey)
- [2. Authenticate and create an API session.](#CreateSession)
- [3. Make an API call.](#MakeAnAPICall)
- [4. Activate configuration changes.](#ActivateChangestoYourConfiguration)
- [5. Log out of the API.](#LoggingOut)
To learn more about rate limiting and HTTP status codes, see [Understanding Rate Limiting](/zia/understanding-rate-limiting) and [API Response Codes and Error Messages](/zia/api-response-codes-and-error-messages). If you encounter any issues with the API, contact Zscaler Support.
Using 3rd-Party App Governance API Key
3rd-Party App Governance API authentication is based on your API key, which is provided to you if you have an 3rd-Party App Governance trial or license. If you do not have a valid API key, submit a Zscaler Support ticket.
When this prerequisite is met, you can securely access the API in the following way:
- [1. Use the base URL.](#AppTotal_retrieve_base_URL)
- [2. Make an API call.](#AppTotal_make_API_call)
Rate limits throttle the number of API calls you can make. The following rate limits apply to all 3rd-Party App Governance API endpoints:
- Trial: 25 per day
- License: 1,000 per day
To learn more about HTTP status codes, see the [API Reference](/zia/apptotal-api). If you encounter any issues with the API, contact Zscaler Support.
[]Your organization must meet the following requirements to be able to use OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- You must have an API subscription. If you do not have a subscription, submit a Zscaler Support ticket.
- You must have the [API Roles](/zia/adding-api-roles) configured in the ZIA Admin Portal.
- You must have your client applications registered on your authorization server (i.e., PingFederate, Okta, or Azure AD) with the required scope and configured appropriately. To learn how to set up client applications on your OAuth 2.0 service provider, refer to the respective help documentation.
- You must have your [OAuth 2.0 authorization server added](/zia/managing-oauth-2.0-authorization-servers#add-auth-server) to the ZIA Admin Portal.
[]The host and basePath for the cloud service API is `$zsapi.``<Zscaler Cloud Name>``/api/v1`. Check which Zscaler cloud name was provisioned for your organization and use it to replace `<Zscaler Cloud Name>`. For example:
- `zsapi.zscalerbeta.net`
- `zsapi.zscalerone.net`
- `zsapi.zscalertwo.net`
- `zsapi.zscalerthree.net`
- `zsapi.zscaler.net`
- `zsapi.zscloud.net`
To locate your base URL:
- Log in to the ZIA Admin Portal using your admin credentials. You must be assigned an admin role that includes the Authentication Configuration functional scope.
- Go to **Administration** > **Cloud Service API Security**.
- On the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Servers** tab, the base URL is displayed within the table.
[]You need to configure the client application registered with the authorization server to send a POST request to the token endpoint with the following parameters and retrieve an access token:
- **client_id:** A unique, public identifier issued to the client application during registration with the authorization server. This identifier is used with `client_secret` for authentication. This information is obtained from the OAuth 2.0 service console.
- **client_secret:** A secret string used by the client application for authenticating with the authorization server. This information is obtained from the OAuth 2.0 service console.
- **grant_type:** The OAuth flow that defines the various methods in which a client application can obtain an authorization grant from the authorization server and the sequence in which the OAuth 2.0 authorization process takes place. The Zscaler service uses the `client_credentials` grant type, which allows clients to access protected resources outside of the context of users.
- **scope:** Scope defines the permissions required by the client application to access the API. You must configure the scope value in the `<Zscaler Cloud Name>``::``<Org ID>``::``<API Role>` format, where:
- `<Zscaler Cloud Name>` represents the cloud on which your organization is provisioned.
- `<Org ID>` represents your organization ID obtained from the ZIA Admin Portal (under Administration > Settings > Company Profile).
- `<API Role>` represents an API role configured in the ZIA Admin Portal (under Administration > Authentication > Role Management).
For example, `zscalerbeta.net::8956412::sampleRole`
The client makes a POST request to the token endpoint with the client credentials (client ID and client secret) presented using HTTP Basic authentication. Alternatively, the client credentials can also be provided using the `client_id` and `client_secret` parameters in the body of the POST request. For more information, refer to [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749, section 2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.3).
Example POST request to the token endpoint:
`POST /as/token.oauth2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9031
Authorization: Basic xxxxxxx
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
{
"grant_type": "client_credentials",
"scope": "zscalerbeta.net::8956412::sampleRole"
}`
If the request is successful, a 200 OK response is returned to the client with the access token and other information in a JSON structure, as follows:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 2022 11:35:21 GMT
X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN
Referrer-Policy: origin
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
{
"access_token": "xxxxxxx",
"token_type": "Bearer",
"expires_in": 7199
}
PF QL6IbHFouxkNFPXZ6uQT06
If an unsuccessful POST request is made to the token endpoint, the response code returns a 400 error.
[]When making API calls, the client must pass the access token in each API request for authentication. The client can present the access token in the request Authorization header using the bearer authentication scheme.
You can write an automation script to enable the client to dynamically retrieve the access token before passing the token in an API request.
In the following example, we look up categories for a specified list of URLs using `/urlLookup`.
Send a POST request to `/urlLookup`:
POST /api/v1/urlLookup HTTP/1.1
Host: zsapi.zscalerbeta.net
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxx
Cache-Control: no-cache
[
"viruses.org",
"facebook.com",
"bbc.com" ]
A successful response to this POST request returns the list of URLs with their category information:

Zscaler recommends sending URLs for lookup in batches. Each request can have up to 100 URLs maximum, and each URL cannot exceed 1,024 characters. To learn more, see URL Categories in the [API Reference](/zia/about-api) and [Configuring URL Categories Using API](/zia/configuring-url-categories-using-api).
When the Zscaler service receives an API request, it validates the access token and accepts the request if authorization is successful. The Zscaler service then extracts the JWT from the request's authorization header and validates the JWT signature using the authorization server's public key fetched from the JWKS endpoint. After successful validation, the client is allowed to access the requested API resources.
The Zscaler service caches the public key set for a brief period of time. If the caching period expires or if the public keys are rotated by the authorization server, then the validation may fail. In such cases, the Zscaler service queries the JWKS endpoint to fetch the public key set. So, you need to program your client application to resend an API request after a minute if the authorization fails for the first time.
If the API call fails due to an upgrade or scheduled maintenance of the API service, a 403 error code is returned, as shown in the following sample response. The API service supports only read operations via GET requests during this period.
HTTP/1.1 403
x-zscaler-mode: read-only
{
"code": "STATE_READONLY",
"message": "The API service is undergoing a scheduled upgrade and is in read-only mode."
}
When making API calls, consider the following best practices:
- Ensure that the lifetime of the access token is set to a desirable value in the OAuth 2.0 service console.
- When updating a resource, always send a GET request before the PUT request. This retrieves the current values for the resource before you update the entire resource with new values.
To send ad hoc requests to the API, Zscaler recommends using the [Postman REST API client](/zia/configuring-postman-rest-api-client).
[]After modifying any configurations, you must activate the changes by sending a POST request to `/status/activate`. As a best practice, if you are making multiple configuration changes, Zscaler recommends grouping the changes and activating once.
To avoid race conditions, do not manually change configuration settings via the ZIA Admin Portal while your scripts are running. The Zscaler service might lock a configuration while a user is editing. When multiple users are editing concurrently, only one user's change succeeds while the remaining users might receive a [409 error](/zia/about-error-handling) (EDIT_LOCK_NOT_AVAILABLE).
If you encounter a race condition and a 409 error code is returned, Zscaler recommends adding a wait cycle of a few seconds and retrying to recover.
You can retrieve the activation status by sending a GET request to `/status`. However, you cannot revert a change and any queued activations cannot be canceled. To learn more, see Activation in the [API Reference](/zia/about-api) and [Saving and Activating Changes in the ZIA Admin Portal](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
[]The host and basePath for the cloud service API is `$zsapi.``<Zscaler Cloud Name>``/api/v1`. Check which Zscaler cloud name was provisioned for your organization and use it to replace `<Zscaler Cloud Name>`. For example:
- `zsapi.zscalerbeta.net`
- `zsapi.zscalerone.net`
- `zsapi.zscalertwo.net`
- `zsapi.zscalerthree.net`
- `zsapi.zscaler.net`
- `zsapi.zscloud.net`
If you are accessing the Sandbox Submission API, your host and basePath is `$csbapi.``<Zscaler Cloud Name>``/zscsb`. (e.g., `$csbapi.zscalerbeta.net/zscsb`).
To locate your base URL and key/token:
- Log in to the ZIA Admin Portal using your admin credentials.
- Go to **Administration** > **Cloud Service API Key Security**.
To view the **Cloud Service API Key Management** page, the admin must be assigned an [admin role](/zia/how-do-i-add-admin-roles) that includes the **Authentication Configuration** [functional scope](/zia/how-do-i-add-admin-roles#authentication-configuration).
- For the cloud service API, on the **Cloud Service API Key** tab, the base URL and key details are displayed within the table. For the Sandbox Submission API, the base URL and token are displayed on the **Sandbox Submission API Token** tab.
An organization can have 1 API key for the cloud service API and up to 5 API tokens for the Sandbox Submission API. To learn more, see [About Cloud Service API Key Management](/zia/about-cloud-service-api-key-management).
- []Obfuscate the API key using one of the following `obfuscateApiKey()` implementation methods:
- [PHP](#phpobfuscate)
- [PowerShell](#powershellobfuscate)
- [Python](#pythonobfuscate)
- [Java](#javaobfuscate)
- [JavaScript](#jsobfuscate)
- [Shell Script](#shellobfuscate)
- []To authenticate via the API and create a new session, send a POST request to `/authenticatedSession` with the following parameters:
- `username`: A string that contains the email ID of the API admin.
- `password`: A string that contains the password for the API admin.
- `apiKey`: A string that contains the obfuscated API key (i.e., the return value of the `obfuscateApiKey()` method).
- `timestamp`: A string that contains a long value that represents the current time in milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. This timestamp value is used to obfuscate the API key given by Zscaler.
Example POST request to `/authenticatedSession`:
POST /api/v1/authenticatedSession HTTP/1.1
Host: zsapi.zscalerbeta.net
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
{
"apiKey": "s0m3rAnd0mKey",
"username": "adminXYZ@acme.com",
"password": "s0m3pa55w0rd",
"timestamp": "1389681124480"
}
A successful response to this POST request would be:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31622400; includeSubDomains; preload
X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=B875640E5EB2DA2C20CF191AE21F91B1; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
Server: Zscaler
{"authType":"ADMIN_LOGIN","obfuscateApiKey":true}
JSESSIONID = B875640E5EB2DA2C20CF191AE21F91B1
The Zscaler service checks that the `timestamp` passed by the `POST /authenticatedSession` request meets the following conditions:
- It is the same `timestamp` used to obfuscate the API key using the `obfuscateApiKey()` method.
- It is within a two-hour range of Zscaler's measured epoch time.
A successful response to `/authenticatedSession` returns a cookie in the `Set-Cookie` header, called `JSESSIONID`, that must be used in subsequent requests. By default, the `JSESSIONID` expires in 5 minutes, or when you explicitly log out by sending a DELETE request to `/authenticatedSession`. If API calls are made after the expiration of `JSESSIONID`, a [401 error](/zia/about-error-handling) is returned. To resume making API calls, reauthenticate the API by sending a POST request to `/authenticatedSession`.
If an unsuccessful POST request is made to `/authenticatedSession` the response code returns a [400 error](/zia/about-error-handling), such as:
{"code":"INVALID_USERNAME_OR_PASSWORD","message":"Invalid email or password"}

}
return retVal;
}
[]JavaScript Implementation:
obfuscateApiKey: function(timestamp, key) {
var high = timestamp.substring(timestamp.length - 6);
var low = (parseInt(high) >> 1).toString();
var apiKey = "";
while (low.length < 6) {
low = "0" + low;
}
for (var i = 0; i < high.length; i++) {

}
for (var j = 0; j < low.length; j++) {

for ((i=0; i<${#n}; i++)); do
tmp=${n:$i:1}
key+=${mykey:$tmp:1}
done
for ((j=0; j<${#o}; j++)); do
tmp=${o:$j:1}+2
key+=${mykey:$tmp:1}
done
[]PHP Implementation:
/**
* @param int $obfuscateTimestamp in MICROseconds
* @param string $apiKey
* @return string
*/
private static function obfuscateApiKey($obfuscateTimestamp, $apiKey)
{
$n = substr($obfuscateTimestamp, -6);
$r = $n >> 1;
$r = str_pad($r, 6, '0', STR_PAD_LEFT);
$obfuscatedApiKey = '';
for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($n); $i++) {
$pos = substr($n, $i, 1);
$obfuscatedApiKey .= substr($apiKey, $pos, 1);
}
for ($j = 0; $j < strlen($r); $j++) {
$pos = substr($r, $j, 1) + 2;
$obfuscatedApiKey .= substr($apiKey, $pos, 1);
}
return $obfuscatedApiKey;
}
The following code is then used to fetch the session cookie (`JSESSIONID`). To learn more about `JSESSIONID`, see [step 2](#LoggingIn)):
$obfuscateTimestamp = (int)(microtime(true) * 1000);
$obfuscatedApiKey = self::obfuscateApiKey($obfuscateTimestamp, 'your_api_key');
By default, the `microtime(true)` function would return a float representing the current time in seconds. So, in the code example, `microtime(true)` is multiplied by 1000 to ensure that the function returns the timestamp in microseconds.
[]PowerShell Implementation:
function obfuscateApiKey {
param (
[string]
#Your API key
$apiKey,
[string]
#Timestamp
$timestamp
)
$high = $timestamp.substring($timestamp.length - 6)
$low = ([int]$high -shr 1).toString()
$obfuscatedApiKey = ''
while ($low.length -lt 6) {
$low = '0' + $low
}
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $high.length; $i++) {
$obfuscatedApiKey += $apiKey[[int64]($high[$i].toString())]
}
for ($j = 0; $j -lt $low.length; $j++) {
$obfuscatedApiKey += $apiKey[[int64]$low[$j].ToString() + 2]
}
return $obfuscatedApiKey
}
[]After modifying any configurations, you must activate the changes by sending a POST request to `/status/activate`. The API change activation request is queued and does not override any simultaneous changes by other admins. As a best practice, if you are making multiple configuration changes, Zscaler recommends grouping the changes and activating once.
To avoid race conditions, do not manually change configuration settings via the ZIA Admin Portal while your scripts are running. The Zscaler service might lock a configuration while a user is editing. When multiple users are editing concurrently, only one user's change succeeds while the remaining users might receive a [409 error](/zia/about-error-handling) (EDIT_LOCK_NOT_AVAILABLE).
If you encounter a race condition and a 409 error code is returned, Zscaler recommends adding a wait cycle of a few seconds and retrying to recover.
The Zscaler service automatically activates the saved changes if the admin:
- is inactive for a specific duration as configured in the [Advanced Settings](/zia/configuring-advanced-settings#session-timeout)
- logs out using DELETE `/authenticatedSession`
You can retrieve the activation status by sending a GET request to `/status`. However, you cannot revert a change and any queued activations cannot be canceled. To learn more, see Activation in the [API Reference](/zia/about-api) and [Saving and Activating Changes in the ZIA Admin Portal](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).

When making API calls, consider the following best practices:
- Always pass the `JSESSIONID` cookie with the request.
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all endpoints (e.g., use the `encodeUriComponent()` function in JavaScript to encode to UTF-8).
- When updating a resource, always send a GET request before the PUT request. This retrieves the current values for the resource before you update the entire resource with new values. After the update, the next GET request for that resource returns the new values.
By using this practice you can avoid potentially missing updates between GET and PUT calls.
- Prevent API call caching by adding a dummy argument with a randomly generated number to all URL request strings. For example:
`GET /urlCategories?_=123456`
- Create a dedicated user for each script. Don't use the same user in multiple scripts that are running concurrently.
- Create an authenticated session only if an API call returns a [401 error](/zia/about-error-handling) (SESSION_NOT_VALID), which indicates that the authenticated session has expired or it does not exist. To learn how to create an authenticated session, see [Authenticate and create an API session](/zia/getting-started-zia-api#CreateSession).
To send ad hoc requests to the API, Zscaler recommends using the [Postman REST API client](/zia/configuring-postman-rest-api-client).
[]To log out of an authenticated API session, send a DELETE request to `/authenticatedSession`.
[]The base URL for the 3rd-Party App Governance API is `https://api.apptotal.zscaler.com/v1/`.
[]When making an API call, consider the following best practices:
- For query parameters, ensure that the provided characters adhere to the specifications outlined in RFC 7230 and RFC 3986.
- Special characters and encoding must follow the standards defined in RFC 3986.
Try making an API call. In the following example, we search for a specified application using `/apps/app`.
Send a GET request to `https://api.apptotal.zscaler.com/v1/apps/app`. In your request, enter the app ID of your desired application and your provided API key.
The following GET request uses cURL. You can use other applicable methods.
curl --request GET 'https://api.apptotal.zscaler.com/v1/apps/app?app_id=22c49a0d-d21c-4792-aed1-8f163c982546' --header 'X-API-KEY: <Your Provided API Key>'
A successful response to this GET request returns the application with its information.
