The web Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS) feed specifies the data from the web logs that the NSS sends to the security information and event management (SIEM) system. You can configure an NSS feed by including one or more fields. The fields and their values display in the NSS feed output.

| %s{threatseverity} | The severity of the threat that was detected in the transaction, if any. The severity relates to the Page Risk Index score. For example, if the value of `%d{riskscore}` is between `90` and `100`, then the value of `%s{threatseverity}` is `Critical`. | Critical (90–100)High (75–89)Medium (46–74)Low (1–45)None (0) | Threat Severity |
| %s{threatname} | The name of the threat that was detected in the transaction, if any | EICAR Test File | Threat Name |
| %s{malwarecat} | The category of malware that was detected in the transaction, if any. Also indicates if a file was submitted to the Sandbox engine for analysis and the result of the analysis. | Adware, Benign, TrojanSandbox Adware, Sandbox Anonymizer, Sandbox MalwareThe full list is under the Threat Category filter on the Web Insights page (Analytics > Web Insights).The Threat Category** Sent for Analysis** is equivalent to “Submitted to Sandbox” in the SIEM output. Additionally, **Other Virus** is equivalent to "Virus" for backward compatibility. | Threat Category |
| %s{malwareclass} | The class of malware that was detected in the transaction, if any | Sandbox | Threat Super Category |

| %d{recordid} | The unique record identifier for each log |  | This field is specific to NSS |
| %s{pcapid} | The path of the packet capture (PCAP) file that captured the transaction. The PCAP ID has the following format: `<Company ID>/<Directory>/<PCAP File Name>`. The company ID is the internal ID of an organization and can be found on the Company Profile page. The directory is the log type. To download the PCAP file, go to the Capture column on the Web Insights Logs page. | 43139974/web/663ba8fd30b50001.pcap | Capture |
| %s{productversion} | The current version of the product. Useful for SIEMs whose format requires the product internal version to be sent in the log output. | 5.0.902.95524_04 | This field is specific to NSS |
| %s{nsssvcip} | The service IP address of the NSS. Useful for syslog-format logs that require the origin host IP address to be specified. | 10.10.102.300 | This field is specific to NSS |
| %s{eedone} | Indicates if the characters specified in the Feed Escape Character field of the NSS feed configuration page were hex encoded | Yes | This field is specific to NSS |
Obfuscated Fields
Select web log fields support obfuscation, as indicated by the prefix `o`. For example, the field `%d{ocip}` is the obfuscated version of `%s{cip}`. Instead of displaying the client IP address, the obfuscated field displays a random string in the NSS feed output.
The following are obfuscated fields:
- %s{ologin}
- %s{obwclassname}
- %s{odlpdict}
- %s{odlpeng}
- %s{odlprulename}
- %s{ordr_rulename}
- %s{ofwd_gw_name}
- %s{ozpa_app_seg_name}
- %d{ocip}
- %d{ocpubip}
- %s{ourlfilterrulelabel}
- %s{oapprulelabel}
- %s{ourlcat}
- %s{odevicehostname}
- %s{odevicename}
- %s{odeviceowner}
b64 Fields
A SIEM can have parsing issues whenever a string field has non-printable or delimiter characters. For that reason, the Zscaler service has URL encoding for URL fields like URL, Referrer, and Hostname. There are several other fields that have the same parsing issue, but URL encoding is not suitable. Such fields are encoded using b64.
Turning on b64 encoding for all supported fields may result in approximately a 20% drop in performance.
The following are b64 fields:
- %s{b64ua}
- %s{b64filename}
- %s{b64upload_filename}
- %s{b64threatname}
- %s{b64mobappname}
- %s{b64host}
- %s{b64url}
- %s{b64referer}
- %s{b64login}
- %s{b64location}
- %s{b64dept}
- %s{b64urlcat}
- %s{b64rulelabel}
- %s{b64urlfilterrulelabel}
- %s{b64apprulelabel}
- %s{b64dlprulename}
- %s{b64rdr_rulename}
- %s{b64fwd_gw_name}
- %s{b64zpa_app_seg_name}
- %s{b64userlocationname}
Hex-Encoded Fields
The Zscaler service hex encodes all non-printable ASCII characters that are in URLs when it sends logs to the NSS. Any URL character that is less than or equal to 0x20, or greater than or equal to 0x7F, is encoded as `%HH`. This ensures that your SIEM can parse the URLs that contain control characters. For example, a `\n` character in a URL is encoded as `%0A`, and a space is encoded as `%20`.
The following are hex-encoded fields:
- %s{eua}
- %s{efilename}
- %s{eupload_filename}
- %s{emobappname}
- %s{ehost}
- %s{eurl}
- %s{ereferer}
- %s{erefererpath}
- %s{eurlpath}
- %s{erefererhost}
- %s{elogin}
- %s{elocation}
- %s{edepartment}
- %s{erulelabel}
- %s{eurlfilterrulelabel}
- %s{eapprulelabel}
- %s{euserlocationname}
- %s{edevicename}
- %s{edevicehostname}
