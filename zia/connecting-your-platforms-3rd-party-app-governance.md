You can connect your platforms to Zscaler 3rd-Party App Governance to gain continuous visibility and governance for the applications and third-party add-ons installed in your environment, take remediation actions, and automate your vetting and governance processes. You can also configure outbound integrations to receive alerts and notifications. To learn more, see [Adding Outbound Integrations](/zia/adding-outbound-integrations).
Connecting your platform to 3rd-Party App Governance is dependent on your license. If you have questions regarding the license, contact your Zscaler Account team.

You can connect the following platforms to 3rd-Party App Governance:
- [Atlassian](/zia/integrating-with-atlassian)
- [GitHub](/zia/integrating-github)
- [Google Workspace](/zia/integrating-with-google-workspace)
- [Microsoft Azure](/zia/integrating-with-microsoft-azure)

After connection is achieved, it might take a while to pull and ingest all relevant application data depending on the size of your tenant. During this time, a message displays indicating that the integration is still being processed. After integration is completed, a success message appears, and the number of integrations, integration status, first connected time, and last synced time are updated. You then receive an email from Zscaler when the application data and** **initial insights on applications connected to your platforms are viewable in the inventory. If the connection fails, an error message appears displaying the reason for the failure. Contact Zscaler Support if you require further assistance.
Additional consent steps are required for the revocation and banning of applications.
