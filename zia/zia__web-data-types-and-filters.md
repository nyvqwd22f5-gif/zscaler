There are two ways you work with web data types and filters to define the web traffic information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/zia/about-widgets), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports) and select Web in the Widget Settings dialog, you select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter** **menu.

The user, department, and location filters list 200 results at a time. They provide search fields where you can type a few characters and the results narrow down to match your input until you find what you want.
Data Types and Filters
Certain filters, like** **Users, Departments, Locations, and others, support the selection of multiple values. For these, you can select up to 200 values in a single filter. You can also choose to include or exclude the selected values.
There are certain filter combinations that don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs. For example, the Department and Location filters don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs when applied.

[]Displays data about advanced threats that the service detected in your organization's web traffic. You can apply the following filters:
- **Advanced Threat Category**: Use this filter to view transactions in which advanced threats were detected. These advanced threats are detected by **Advanced Threat Protection**. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific categories. The following categories appear under this filter:
- **Adware/Spyware Sites**: This category refers to any detections of websites known to contain adware or spyware based on the URL/IP reputation. The URLs/IPs added in this category would be associated with distributing adware or spyware, which can collect information related to the user’s browsing activities and display unwanted advertisements without the user’s consent.
- **Any**
- **Botnet Callback**: This is the most important threat category because the Sandbox detects post-infection activity, which requires you to follow up and remediate. There are two types of detections: destination URL reputation and content IPS signature, which are both part of Advanced Threat Protection. URL reputation-based detections, especially those that match only a domain or even an IP address, are lower fidelity and have a lower chance of the affected endpoint actually being infected by a botnet agent. This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Department**: Use this filter to view data for advanced threats detected in the web traffic of a specific department. You can choose to include or exclude certain departments.
- **Location**: Use this filter to limit the data to advanced threats detected in the web traffic of a specific location. Choose a location from the list of internet gateway locations specified on the Locations page.

[]Displays data about the web traffic of your organization’s location group. You can apply the following filters:
- **Advanced Threat Category**: Use this filter to view data for a specific advanced threat that was detected by the service. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific categories. The following categories appear under this filter:
- **Adware/Spyware Sites**: This category refers to any detections of websites known to contain adware or spyware based on the URL/IP reputation. The URLs/IPs added in this category would be associated with distributing adware or spyware, which can collect information related to the user’s browsing activities and display unwanted advertisements without the user’s consent.
- **Any**
- **Botnet Callback**: This is the most important threat category because the Sandbox detects post-infection activity, which requires you to follow up and remediate. There are two types of detections: destination URL reputation and content IPS signature, which are both part of Advanced Threat Protection. URL reputation-based detections, especially those that match only a domain or even an IP address, are lower fidelity and have a lower chance of the affected endpoint actually being infected by a botnet agent. This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.

[]Displays data about the web traffic of your organization's location type. You can apply the following filters:
- **Advanced Threat Category**: Use this filter to view data for a specific advanced threat that was detected by the service. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific categories. The following categories appear under this filter:
- **Adware/Spyware Sites**: This category refers to any detections of websites known to contain adware or spyware based on the URL/IP reputation. The URLs/IPs added in this category would be associated with distributing adware or spyware, which can collect information related to the user’s browsing activities and display unwanted advertisements without the user’s consent.
- **Any**
- **Botnet Callback**: This is the most important threat category because the Sandbox detects post-infection activity, which requires you to follow up and remediate. There are two types of detections: destination URL reputation and content IPS signature, which are both part of Advanced Threat Protection. URL reputation-based detections, especially those that match only a domain or even an IP address, are lower fidelity and have a lower chance of the affected endpoint actually being infected by a botnet agent. This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Cloud Application**: Use this filter to limit the data to a specific application, such as Facebook. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific apps.

This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.

This type of malware allows a person to use the infected device to attack other devices, send spam, or impersonate your device. The Zscaler service detects proxy-related content through file reputation or signature matching (e.g., antivirus).
- **Ransomware**: This category refers to any detections of ransomware installers, agents, or related content through file reputation, signature matching (e.g., antivirus or YARA), or machine learning model techniques.
- **Sandbox Adware**: This category refers to any known malicious Sandbox file detections that install persistent components to push advertising content to users' devices. Often, these advertisements are unwanted and can lead to spyware or other grayware-oriented privacy violations.
- **Sandbox Anonymizer**: This category refers to any known malicious Sandbox file detections that exhibit behavior consistent with anonymizer programs, such as Tor Browser or other VPN services, that essentially make a user’s internet activity untraceable.
- **Sandbox Malware**: This is a catchall category for any known malicious Sandbox file detections that don't fall under the other Sandbox categories. Most Sandbox-classified files aren't clearly known to be a specific threat or malware family-oriented because there aren't specific signatures or indicators to categorize the file. Instead, the Zscaler service categorizes the file based on an aggregation of the file’s OS and application behaviors and network activity.
- **Sandbox Offensive Security** **Tools**: This category refers to the threat actors that can use offensive security tools for malicious reasons. They can also be used by cybersecurity professionals.
- **Sandbox Ransomware**: This category refers to the type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system or by locking the users' files, until a ransom is paid.

- **Advanced Threat Category**: Use this filter to view transactions in which advanced threats were detected. These advanced threats are detected by **Advanced Threat Protection**. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific categories. The following categories appear under this filter:
- **Adware/Spyware Sites**: This category refers to any detections of websites known to contain adware or spyware based on the URL/IP reputation. The URLs/IPs added in this category would be associated with distributing adware or spyware, which can collect information related to the user’s browsing activities and display unwanted advertisements without the user’s consent.
- **Any**
- **Botnet Callback**: This is the most important threat category because the Sandbox detects post-infection activity, which requires you to follow up and remediate. There are two types of detections: destination URL reputation and content IPS signature, which are both part of Advanced Threat Protection. URL reputation-based detections, especially those that match only a domain or even an IP address, are lower fidelity and have a lower chance of the affected endpoint actually being infected by a botnet agent. This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Cloud Application**: Use this filter to view transactions associated with a specific app class. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific apps. You can choose to include or exclude certain apps.

This type of malware allows a person to use the infected device to attack other devices, send spam, or impersonate your device. The Zscaler service detects proxy-related content through file reputation or signature matching (e.g., antivirus).
- **Ransomware**: This category refers to any detections of ransomware installers, agents, or related content through file reputation, signature matching (e.g., antivirus or YARA), or machine learning model techniques.
- **Sandbox Adware**: This category refers to any known malicious Sandbox file detections that install persistent components to push advertising content to users' devices. Often, these advertisements are unwanted and can lead to spyware or other grayware-oriented privacy violations.
- **Sandbox Anonymizer**: This category refers to any known malicious Sandbox file detections that exhibit behavior consistent with anonymizer programs, such as Tor Browser or other VPN services, that essentially make a user’s internet activity untraceable.
- **Sandbox Malware**: This is a catchall category for any known malicious Sandbox file detections that don't fall under the other Sandbox categories. Most Sandbox-classified files aren't clearly known to be a specific threat or malware family-oriented because there aren't specific signatures or indicators to categorize the file. Instead, the Zscaler service categorizes the file based on an aggregation of the file’s OS and application behaviors and network activity.
- **Sandbox Offensive Security** **Tools**: This category refers to the threat actors that can use offensive security tools for malicious reasons. They can also be used by cybersecurity professionals.
- **Sandbox Ransomware**: This category refers to the type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system or by locking the users' files, until a ransom is paid.
- **Sent for Analysis**: This category refers to any unknown file detections that have been sent to the Sandbox for behavioral analysis.
- **Trojan**: This category refers to any detections of trojan installers or related content through file reputation, signature matching (e.g., antivirus or YARA), or machine learning model techniques.

[]Displays web traffic data grouped according to transactions that were allowed or blocked. You can apply the following filters:
- **Advanced Threat Category**: Use this filter to view data for a specific advanced threat that was detected by the service. The default option for this filter is **Any**. You can search for specific categories. The following categories appear under this filter:
- **Adware/Spyware Sites**: This category refers to any detections of websites known to contain adware or spyware based on the URL/IP reputation. The URLs/IPs added in this category would be associated with distributing adware or spyware, which can collect information related to the user’s browsing activities and display unwanted advertisements without the user’s consent.
- **Any**
- **Botnet Callback**: This is the most important threat category because the Sandbox detects post-infection activity, which requires you to follow up and remediate. There are two types of detections: destination URL reputation and content IPS signature, which are both part of Advanced Threat Protection. URL reputation-based detections, especially those that match only a domain or even an IP address, are lower fidelity and have a lower chance of the affected endpoint actually being infected by a botnet agent. This is because some indicators detect when a user happens to visit a web destination that is known to serve or be associated with malicious botnet payloads or communication, so the user is protected from preinfection. The IPS signature-based detections generally match the botnet communication pattern/protocol, so they are more likely to signal that the affected endpoint is actually infected by a botnet agent.
- **Browser Exploit**: This category refers to any detections of known exploits against web browsers. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Cross-site Scripting**: This category refers to any detections that try to abuse an end user via a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into benign and trusted websites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, typically through browser-side scripting, to a different end user. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections, so they are high fidelity.
- **Crypto Mining & Blockchain**: This category refers to any detections of crypto mining or crypto-jacking activity or sites associated with malicious cryptocurrency activity. General cryptocurrency websites and content aren't blocked by this category, but those that are designed to abuse user's devices without their consent via browser-based scripts that mine cryptocurrency. These detections are often IPS signature-based detections with the actual scripts hiding on or behind web pages, so they are high fidelity.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) Domains**: This category refers to the domains that are suspected to be generated using domain generation algorithms (DGA). These algorithms are used in various malware families to periodically generate a large number of domain names that can be used by malware-infected devices to connect with command and control servers in order to circumvent the identification and shutting down of malicious domains.
- **Malicious Content**: This category refers to any detections of malware or websites known to host malware and other malicious content that isn't attributed to a specific threat type or category. The detection capabilities in this category are often based upon various signature types and patterns, such as URL reputation, IPS signatures, etc.
- **Other Threat**: This is a catchall category for any detections that might not have an appropriate mapping to a specific category.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: This category refers to any detections of peer-to-peer traffic via applications such as BitTorrent, Tor, and other anonymizer or file-sharing applications. These applications can be across any port. You also must have a Firewall for the Zscaler service to detect and block these applications.
- **Phishing**: This category is one of the most powerful detection capabilities in the Advanced Threat Protection policy. It refers to any detections that are both URL reputation and IPS content signature-based. The ThreatLabZ operations team focuses on writing new phishing IPS signatures based on the patterns discovered and extracted from the phishing attacks observed by the Zscaler service and outside threat intelligence sources and partners. ThreatLabZ proactively scans and reviews all newly registered domains to discover new phishing and credential-stealing URLs and ensure phishing IPS signature coverage for any new phishing patterns.
- **Spyware Callback**: This category refers to any detections of communication and callback traffic associated with spyware agents and data transmission. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.
- **Suspicious Content**: This category refers to any detections from the Suspicious Content Protection (PageRisk) engine. You can configure the Zscaler service to block users from accessing web pages with a high [Page Risk Index (PRI) score](/zia/configuring-advanced-threat-protection-policy#pagerisk). The Zscaler service analyzes malicious content on a web page (e.g, injected scripts, vulnerable ActiveX, zero-pixel iFrames, etc.) and creates a Page Risk Index. The service also analyzes data from the domain (e.g., hosting country, domain age, past results, links to high-risk top-level domains, etc.) and creates a Domain Risk Index. The Page Risk and Domain Risk Index are combined to produce a single PRI score. This score is then evaluated against the value you set.
- **Suspicious Destination**: This category refers to any detections of internet activity destined for specific countries where the website IP address is geographically located and hosted from. This detection is based on the countries you decide to block access to in your policies.
- **Unauthorized Communication**: This category refers to any detections of unauthorized, tunneling, or anonymizer traffic such as IRC traffic, SSH tunneling, Tor anonymizer traffic, etc. The Zscaler service detects this content via specialized IPS content signatures that match the traffic patterns associated with this kind of communication.
- **Web Spam**: This category refers to any URL detections from web-based email spam scams and specific phishing attacks within web email content. The Zscaler service detects this content using high-fidelity IPS signatures that match content patterns in web traffic.

- **Sandbox Anonymizer**: This category refers to any known malicious Sandbox file detections that exhibit behavior consistent with anonymizer programs, such as Tor Browser or other VPN services, that essentially make a user’s internet activity untraceable.
- **Sandbox Malware**: This is a catchall category for any known malicious Sandbox file detections that don't fall under the other Sandbox categories. Most Sandbox-classified files aren't clearly known to be a specific threat or malware family-oriented because there aren't specific signatures or indicators to categorize the file. Instead, the Zscaler service categorizes the file based on an aggregation of the file’s OS and application behaviors and network activity.
- **Sandbox Offensive Security** **Tools**: This category refers to the threat actors that can use offensive security tools for malicious reasons. They can also be used by cybersecurity professionals.
