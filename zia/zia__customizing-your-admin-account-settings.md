The ZIA service automatically creates a profile for each administrator account where you can change your password, change your ZIA Admin Portal color theme, among other things.
- [To apply a color theme to the ZIA Admin Portal for your profile](#choose-color-theme)
- [To view or customize your profile](#customize-admin)
- []Hover over the **User** icon to view the **Account** pane.
- Choose one of the following color themes for your ZIA Admin Portal.
- Default
- Blue
- Dark blue
The selected color theme is only applicable to your admin profile.

- []Go to **My Profile** by doing either of the following::
- Click the **User **icon in the bottom-left corner.
- Go to **Administration** > **My Profile**.
-
On the **My Profile** page:
- **User Display Name**: Your login ID assigned when your admin account was created.
-
**Password**: Change your password for the ZIA Admin Portal. The Zscaler service applies the strongest restrictions and complexity. The password must contain at least 8 characters and include 1 number, 1 upper-case character, and 1 special character. Only ASCII characters are allowed.
This change also applies to all other Zscaler Admin Portals (e.g., ZDX Admin Portal) that you access with the same admin credentials.
- **Language**: By default, the ZIA Admin Portal is displayed in English. You can change the language to French, German, Japanese, Spanish, or Simplified Chinese.
- **Auto Refresh Dashboard?**: Enable the dashboards to automatically refresh every 15 minutes.
- **Policy Information**: Enable to display policy descriptions at the top of each policy window in the ZIA Admin Portal.
- **Timezone**: When the Zscaler service saves transactions, it uses UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The time zone is used only for exporting logs to CSV files. It does not affect the generated logs in the ZIA Admin Portal because the system time zone determines the time stamp of the generated logs.
