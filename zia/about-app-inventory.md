The App Inventory enables you to gain the right visibility into, manage, and govern your third-party apps, add-ons, and extensions. You can automatically populate your inventory with apps by leveraging 3rd-Party App Governance’s discovery capabilities,[ connecting your various SaaS platforms to 3rd-Party App Governance](/zia/connecting-your-platforms-3rd-party-app-governance), manually [uploading apps](/zia/uploading-apps-bulk), and by [searching](/zia/searching-apps) and adding from the 3rd-Party App Governance catalog.
The App Inventory provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Search and review a specific app, and filter apps by any given criteria (e.g., Permission Level, Risk Score, etc.).
- Pre-vet an app; change the app risk score; classify apps; take automated actions such as revoke, ban, or review; create custom views; generate reports;** **devise policies; and more.
