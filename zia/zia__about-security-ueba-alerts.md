The Security & UEBA alerting framework provides a comprehensive solution to view, manage, create, and adjust the alert rules. The security alerts constantly filter and evaluate all the logs generated from your organization's traffic to trigger new alerts. The User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) alert rules for the inline and API channels cover multiple events and alert types based on your organizational requirements. This article provides the details of Security alerts and UEBA alerts.

Ensure that you enable the alert rules and set up the alert notification delivery. You can either use email aliases or webhooks to receive alert notifications. After the alert rule is set up, you can start investigating the generated alerts by viewing the various available widgets or the alert summary table. You can create new rules or edit existing rules based on organizational requirements or team responsibilities.
The Security and UEBA Alerts provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View, manage, and customize your alerts with ease.
- Stay secure and informed about critical security events by constantly evaluating your organization’s logs and real-time notifications.
- Keep track of all alerts with the help of high-level statistics and a centralized console.

[]UEBA is a cybersecurity technique that focuses on detecting and analyzing abnormal behaviors exhibited by users and entities within an organization's network environment. It uses advanced analytics to study user activities that indicate potential security threats or insider threats.
By monitoring and analyzing user activities, such as logins, file accesses, data transfers, and application usage, UEBA alerts can detect deviations from normal behavior, flagging suspicious activities for further investigation and response.
The ZIA UEBA alerts provide extensive functionality to detect and respond to flagged activities. This alert type is available for Inline and API channels for better monitoring.
