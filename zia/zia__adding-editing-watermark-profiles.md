You can use watermark profiles as part of your SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy to protect files that trigger policy rules. When sensitive content triggers a SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning DLP rule, the Zscaler service uses the watermark profile associated with the policy rule to superimpose text diagonally across pages and images to clearly identify the content you want to protect. Additionally, you can include headers and footers as part of your watermark profiles.
