This article describes how to delete individual admin accounts in the ZIA Admin Portal. Zscaler provides a default admin account that has full access to the ZIA Admin Portal and scope over the entire organization. This account can't be deleted.
To delete an admin:
- Go to **Administration **>** Administrator Management**.
- Click the **Edit** icon for the admin you want to delete.

The **Confirm Changes** window appears.
- In the **Confirm Changes** window:
- **Yes**: Click to delete the admin and remove them as a [user](/zia/about-users) in your organization.
- **No**: Click to delete the admin, but keep them as a [user](/zia/about-users) in your organization.

These options aren't available if you're using an [Active Directory or OpenLDAP directory server](/zia/synchronizing-user-data-active-directory-openldap) for user authentication. Instead, you must click **Confirm**.
- [Activate the change](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
