There are two ways you work with Firewall data types and filters to define Firewall traffic information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/zia/what-widget), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports) and select Firewall in the Widget Settings dialog, you can select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu.

In the Analytics >** **Firewall Insights page, you select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu on the left pane.

Data Types and Filters
Certain filters, like** **Users, Departments, Locations, and others, support the selection of multiple values. For these, you can select up to 200 values in a single filter. You can also choose to include or exclude the selected values.
There are certain filter combinations that don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs. For example, the Department and Location filters don't appear together in Insights, but appear together in Insights Logs when applied.
Certain data types only appear on the Firewall Insights page and not on the Dashboard > New Widget window. The following are the firewall data types and their associated filters that appear on both the pages:
- [Action](#action)
- [Application Segment](#app-segment)
- [Department](#department)
