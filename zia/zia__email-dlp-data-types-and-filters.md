There are two ways you can use Email Data Loss Prevention (DLP) data types and filters to define the Email DLP activities information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/zia/what-widget), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports) and select Email DLP in the Widget Settings dialog, you select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu.

On the Analytics >** **Email DLP Insights page, you select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter menu on the left pane.

The user and department filters list 200 results at a time. They provide search fields in which you can type a few characters and the results narrow to match your input until you find what you want.
Data Types and Filters
