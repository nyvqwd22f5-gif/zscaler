# GRE Configuration Guide for Juniper SRX

This guide provides examples for configuring a GRE tunnel between a Juniper SRX300 running Junos OS version 19.2R2.7 and ZIA Public Service Edges in the Zscaler service.
As shown in the illustration, primary and secondary GRE tunnels are configured from the gateway port of the Juniper SRX to two ZIA Public Service Edges in the Zscaler service.
![Diagram of GRE tunnel configuration from Juniper SRX to ZIA Public Service Edges](/downloads/zia/traffic-forwarding/gre/gre-configuration-example-juniper-srx/zia_gre_juniper_srx.png)
The public IP address of the gateway port gr-0/0/0 on the router is <Tunnel Source IP>.
The router receives ingress traffic on port ge-0/0/4. It forwards outbound traffic to ge-0/0/0 in the Untrust Zone, which uses the two sub-interfaces, unit0 and unit1, to send internet traffic through the GRE tunnel to the Zscaler service. It performs NAT on the traffic that it sends directly to the internet. For more information on configuring a GRE tunnel, see [Configuring GRE Tunnels](/zia/configuring-gre-tunnels).
For more information about Juniper SRX300, see the [Juniper documentation](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/product/us/en/srx300/).
Prerequisites
The following parameters shown in red are required to configure a GRE tunnel with keepalives:
- <Tunnel Source IP>: The IP address of the tunnel source, which is from your organization (e.g., 10.96.19.5).
- <Internal IP Range>: The internal range of IP addresses assigned by Zscaler for your organization (e.g., 172.23.119.128 - 172.23.119.131).
- <Primary DC VIP>: The IP address of the primary tunnel destination, which is the GRE virtual IP address of Zscaler's primary data center (e.g., 10.66.45.208)
- <Primary Internal Router IP>: The internal virtual IP of the router (tunnel source) for the GRE tunnel associated with the primary data center (e.g., 172.23.119.129).
- <Primary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP>: The internal virtual IP of the tunnel destination on the primary data center (e.g., 172.23.119.130).
- <Secondary DC VIP>: The IP address of the secondary tunnel destination, which is the GRE virtual IP address of Zscaler's secondary data center (e.g., 10.66.45.250).
- <Secondary Internal Router IP>: The internal virtual IP of the router (tunnel source) for the GRE tunnel associated with the secondary data center (e.g., 172.23.119.133).
- <Secondary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP>: The internal virtual IP of the tunnel destination on the secondary data center (e.g., 172.23.119.134)
- <Keepalive Time>: The interval (in seconds) to send the NAT keepalive messages to detect if a tunnel is down.
- <Hold Time>: The time (in seconds) that the originating end of a GRE tunnel waits for keepalive packets from the other end of the tunnel before marking the tunnel as operationally down. The hold time must be at least twice the keepalive time.
Configuring a GRE Tunnel
Refer to the following procedure to configure a GRE tunnel between Juniper SRX300 and ZIA Public Service Edges. Replace the sample values shown in red with the actual values for your deployment.
- [Step 1. Configure a GRE tunnel with keepalives.](#configure-gre-tunnel-keepalives)
- [Step 2. Create an ICMP-based probe to monitor the GRE endpoints on the Zscaler service.](#create-icmp-probe)
- [Step 3. Enable IP monitoring for the probe.](#enable-ip-monitoring)
- [Step 4. Create the required security zones.](#configure-security-zones)
- [Step 5. Configure security policies that allow the specified traffic to and from the Trust and Untrust zones.](#configure-security-policies)
[]Use the following commands to configure a GRE tunnel with keepalives:
root@srx300> show configuration interfaces gr-0/0/0
unit 0 {
tunnel {
source 10.96.19.5;
destination 10.66.45.208;
}
family inet {
address 172.23.119.129/30;
}
}
root@srx300# show protocols oam
gre-tunnel {
traceoptions {
file gre_tun.log;
flag all;
}
interface gr-0/0/0 {
keepalive-time 10;
hold-time 60;
}
}
[]Use the following command to create an ICMP-based probe to monitor the GRE endpoints (<Primary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP> and <Secondary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP>) on the Zscaler service:
root@srx300# run show configuration services rpm
probe icmp_gre_tunnel {
test icmp {
probe-type icmp-ping;
target address 172.23.119.130;
probe-count 5;
probe-interval 5;
test-interval 10;
source-address 172.23.119.129;
thresholds {
successive-loss 5;
total-loss 5;
}
[]Use the following command to enable IP monitoring. The probe is sent to the primary interface at the Primary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP (e.g., 172.23.119.130).
root@srx300# run show configuration services ip-monitoring
policy failover {
match {
rpm-probe icmp_gre_tunnel;
}
then {
preferred-route {
routing-instances traffic_tunnel {
route 0.0.0.0/0 {
next-hop 172.23.119.130;
}
}
}
}
}
[]Use the following command to configure the required security zones:
root@srx300# run show configuration security zones
functional-zone management {
ge-0/0/5.0 {
host-inbound-traffic {
system-services {
https;
ping;
ssh;
}
}
}
ge-0/0/1.0 {
host-inbound-traffic {
system-services {
all;
}
}
}
}
}
security-zone trust {
host-inbound-traffic {
system-services {
all;
}
protocols {
all;
}
}
interfaces {
irb.0;
}
}
security-zone untrust {
screen untrust-screen;
host-inbound-traffic {
protocols {
all;
}
}
interfaces {
ge-0/0/0.0 {
host-inbound-traffic {
system-services {
dhcp;
tftp;
https;
ping;
ssh;
}
}
}
st0.0;
gr-0/0/0.0;
}
[]Use the following command to configure security policies, allowing the specified traffic from the Trust zone to the Untrust zone and vice versa:
root@srx300# run show configuration security policies
from-zone trust to-zone trust {
policy trust-to-trust {
match {
source-address any;
destination-address any;
application any;
}
then {
permit;
}
}
}
from-zone trust to-zone untrust {
policy trust-to-untrust {
match {
source-address any;
destination-address any;
application any;
}
then {
permit;
}
}
}
Verifying the GRE Tunnel Configuration
In the ZIA Admin Portal, you can go to Analytics > Tunnel Insights to see data and monitor the health and status of your configured GRE tunnels. To learn more, see [About Insights](/zia/about-insights) and [About Insights Logs](/zia/about-insights-logs).
In Junos OS, you can use the following commands to monitor and troubleshoot the GRE tunnels.
- [Verify the Reachability of GRE Endpoints on the Zscaler Service](#verify-gre-endpoints)
- [Verify the GRE Tunnel Status on Juniper SRX](#verify-gre-tunnel-status)
- [Verify the ICMP Probe Results](#verify-probe-results)
- [Verify IP Monitoring](#verify-ip-monitoring)
[]Use the `ping` command to verify the reachability of GRE endpoints on the Zscaler service for the Primary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP. In the following example, 172.23.119.130 is the Primary Internal ZIA Public Service Edge IP and 172.23.119.129 is the Primary Internal Router IP.
root@srx300> ping 172.23.119.130 source 172.23.119.129
PING 172.23.119.130 (172.23.119.130): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.23.119.130: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=8.135 ms
64 bytes from 172.23.119.130: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=6.322 ms
64 bytes from 172.23.119.130: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=3.664 ms
[]Use the `show interfaces gr-/0/0/0 extensive` command to verify the GRE keepalives adjacency state is up.
root@srx300# run show interfaces gr-0/0/0 extensive

When the data center under the GRE virtual IP goes down, Juniper SRX does not receive a keepalive message response and the adjacency state goes `down`. See the following example:
