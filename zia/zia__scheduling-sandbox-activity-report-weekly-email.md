The [Sandbox Activity Report](/zia/about-sandbox-activity-report) is HTML-based and provides a quick snapshot of the Sandbox policy action taken for known and unknown files in your organization.
The Zscaler service can directly email your recipients a preview of the Sandbox Activity Report and a link to the full report. The full report is a static page where recipients can view and print the report.
Anyone who has the link can access the report. The link is valid for 15 days only.
