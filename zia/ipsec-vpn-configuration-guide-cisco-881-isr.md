This article uses only sample IP addresses in the configuration steps and screenshots. For tunnel interface configuration, you must use only RFC 1918 IP addresses and not APIPA addresses.
This article illustrates how to configure two IPSec VPN tunnels from a Cisco 881 Integrated Services Router (ISR) to two ZIA Public Service Edges: a primary tunnel from the router to a ZIA Public Service Edge in one data center and a secondary tunnel from the router to a ZIA Public Service Edge in another data center.
![A network diagram showing the primary and secondary IPSec tunnels from a Cisco ISR appliance to two Zscaler ZIA Public Service Edges.](/downloads/zia/traffic-forwarding/ipsec/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr/zia-ipsec-cisco-isr.png)
Zscaler IPSec tunnels support a limit of 400 Mbps for each public source IP address. If your organization wants to forward more than 400 Mbps of traffic, Zscaler recommends using one of the following configurations:
- Configure multiple IPSec tunnels with different public source IP addresses.
- Configure multiple IPSec VPN tunnels with the same public source IP address using Network Address Translation Traversal (NAT-T) and source port randomization with IKEv2 for all the configured tunnels.
For example, if your organization forwards 800 Mbps of traffic, you can configure two primary VPN tunnels and two backup VPN tunnels.
Organizations typically forward all traffic destined for any port to the Zscaler service. Alternatively, you can limit the traffic that you forward to Zscaler to HTTP and HTTPS traffic (i.e., traffic destined for port 80 and port 443). Regardless, tunneling provides visibility into the internal IP addresses, which can be used for the Zscaler security policies and logging.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following information for setting up the IPSec VPN tunnels:
- [IP addresses of the ZIA Public Service Edges (IKEv2)](/zia/locating-the-hostnames-and-ip-addresses-your-zens)
- [Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP addresses](/zia/global-zscaler-enforcement-nodes-zens)
- [Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)](/zia/determining-the-optimal-mtu-for-gre-or-ipsec-tunnels)
- [Zscaler cloud name](/zia/what-my-cloud-name)
If you are unable to ping both ZIA Public Service Edge IP addresses, contact Zscaler Support.
Configuring the IPSec VPN Tunnel in the ZIA Admin Portal
In this configuration example, the peers are using an FQDN and a pre-shared key (PSK) for authentication.
To configure the IPSec VPN tunnels in the ZIA Admin Portal:
- [Add the VPN Credential](/zia/adding-individual-vpn-credentials)
You need the FQDN and PSK when linking the VPN credentials to a location and creating the IKE gateways.
- [Link the VPN Credentials to a Location](/zia/how-do-i-add-location#vpn-credentials)
Configuring the IPSec VPN Tunnel on Cisco 881 ISR
This article only covers the configuration details of IPSec VPN tunnels between the Cisco 881 ISR and the ZIA Public Service Edges. For any other specific information about the Cisco 881 ISR, refer to the [Cisco documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/881-secure-fast-ethernet-multi-mode-4g-lte-isr-router/model.html?dtid=osscdc000283).
This section describes how to configure two IPSec VPN tunnels on Cisco 881 ISR running Cisco IOS 15.4(3)M3. Both tunnels must be configured at your gateway. Only a single tunnel is operational at any time. The second tunnel acts as a backup tunnel. This configuration uses CLI commands. To learn more about these commands, refer to the [Cisco documentation](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/881-secure-fast-ethernet-multi-mode-4g-lte-isr-router/model.html?dtid=osscdc000283). You must have a Cisco 881 ISR running Cisco IOS version 15.1.1T or later to configure IKEv2.
You must provide the following information to configure the tunnels:
- <FQDN> - The FQDN of the VPN credentials you created in the ZIA Admin Portal.
- <Pre-Shared Key> - The pre-shared key of the VPN credentials you created in the ZIA Admin Portal.
- <LAN Interface> - The LAN interface of the ISR.
- <WAN Interface> - The WAN interface of the ISR.
- <MTU> - The optimal MTU for the tunnels.
- <Primary VPN IP Address> and <Backup VPN IP Address> - The IP addresses of the ZIA Public Service Edges.
- <Primary Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP Address> and <Backup Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP Address> - The global IP addresses of the ZIA Public Service Edges.
- <Exempted Server IP> - Traffic to this IP address or IP subnet is not sent through the VPN tunnels to Zscaler. The IP address or IP subnet can be an internal server farm reachable through a router or an external public IP address that must be excluded from being routed through the tunnel.
- <Zscaler Cloud> - Your Zscaler cloud name.
To configure the IPSec VPN tunnel on Cisco 881 ISR:
Zscaler does not support Extended Sequence Number (ESN) based proposals during IPSec tunnel negotiation.

[]Create an ACL to send relevant traffic through the tunnel. Most organizations forward all traffic to Zscaler. You can use any of the following commands to configure your ACL:
- If you want to send all traffic through the tunnel, enter the following:
access-list <ACL Number> permit ip any any
- If you only want to send web traffic (i.e., HTTP and HTTPS) through the tunnel, enter the following:
access-list <ACL Number> permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list <ACL Number> permit tcp any any eq 443
- If you want traffic to a web server to be exempted from going through the tunnel, enter the following:
access-list <ACL Number> deny ip any <Exempted Server IP>
access-list <ACL Number> permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list <ACL Number> permit tcp any any eq 443
You need the <ACL Number> for [12. Define the Route Map](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-route-map).
[]Define a route map that links the ACL with the tunnel interfaces. You need the <ACL Number> created in [11. Create the Access Control List (ACL)](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-acl) and the <Primary Tunnel Interface> and <Backup Tunnel Interface> created in [10. Create the Tunnel Interfaces](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-tunnel-interfaces).
Enter the following commands:
route-map <Route Map Name> permit 1
match ip address <ACL Number>
set interface <Primary Tunnel Interface> <Backup Tunnel Interface>
You need the <Route Map Name> for [13. Configure Network Address Translation (NAT)](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-nat).
[]Configure NAT on the WAN and LAN interfaces. You need the <Route Map Name> created in [12. Define the Route Map](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-route-map).
Enter the following commands:
interface <WAN Interface>
description $ES_WAN$
ip address 10.96.19.244 255.255.255.0

[]The IP SLA monitor is used to provide failover between the two tunnels. If the primary tunnel fails, the backup tunnel is used automatically. Ensure the IP address used for VPN monitoring is reachable.
The following IP SLAs are defined as `ip sla 1 `and `ip sla 2`. In your configuration, you can optionally define different values for the tracking object and the IP SLA operation ID numbers (e.g., `track 3 ip sla 3`). The ID numbers show in the output of the `show track ``<ID>` command when later [tracking the IP SLA status](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-guide-cisco-881-isr#ipslastatus).
You need the <Primary Tunnel Interface> and <Backup Tunnel Interface> created in [10. Create the Tunnel Interfaces](/zia/ipsec-vpn-configuration-example-cisco-881-isr#ikev2-tunnel-interfaces).
If you use PAC files to forward traffic through the tunnel, ensure that you use different Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP addresses for IP SLA monitoring and your PAC files. Using the same Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP addresses causes the PAC files to send all packets through the same tunnel regardless of the tunnel interface state.
Enter the following commands:
config IP SLA
track 1 ip sla 1 state
delay down 180 up 180
track 2 ip sla 2 state
delay down 180 up 180
ip route <Primary Global ZIA Public Service Edge IP Address> 255.255.255.255 <Primary Tunnel Interface> permanent

[]Use the `show crypto ipsec sa` command to troubleshoot Phase 2 of the tunnel. The response shows an organization’s gateway with IKE configured correctly. Ensure that some packets are encapsulated and decapsulated for the primary and secondary tunnel and that the inbound and outbound ESP SAs have an` ACTIVE `status. This indicates that traffic is flowing through the tunnel.
The <Corporate Public IP> is the IP address on the router from which the IPSec tunnel is established.
