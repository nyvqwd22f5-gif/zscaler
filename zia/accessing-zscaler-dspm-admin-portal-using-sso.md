Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) helps protect an organization’s data stored in your cloud resources against data theft, misuse, or loss by continuously scanning the data and numerous potential misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and permissions that might contribute to attack vectors. DSPM provides detailed insights into where this sensitive data resides in your cloud environment, sensitive data types, and misconfigurations in data stores that contain sensitive data. To learn more, see[ DSPM Help](/dspm).
You can access the DSPM Admin Portal from the ZIA Admin Portal using SSO, if you have subscribed to the DSPM service and if a DSPM Admin or DSPM Super Admin role is assigned to you. To learn more about predefined roles and permissions in DSPM, see [About Roles](/dspm/about-roles). To check if you are subscribed to the DSPM service, you can view your company subscriptions to confirm if a DSPM license is present. To learn more, see [Viewing Subscriptions](/zia/viewing-subscriptions).
To access the DSPM Admin Portal, in the ZIA Admin Portal, go to **Dashboard** > **Zscaler DSPM Portal**, or **Policy** >** Zscaler DSPM Portal**.
The Admin with view permission can access the DSPM Admin Portal only from the** Dashboard**.
