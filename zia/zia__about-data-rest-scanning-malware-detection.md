The SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning Malware Detection policy allows you to create rules to discover and prevent threats to data at rest in sanctioned SaaS applications.
Adding a malware policy for a SaaS application provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Maintain individualized malware policies for each SaaS application tenant in your organization.
- Detect and remove malware threats to extend comprehensive web security to your SaaS applications.
As shown in the following table, each SaaS application allows you to configure the policy to report, quarantine, or delete suspicious files. You can also configure exceptions to the policy.

After creating a policy rule, you must schedule a scan for it to inspect content based on the rule's specifications (e.g., tenant, DLP engines, action, etc.). To learn more, see [About SaaS Security Scan Configuration](/zia/about-saas-security-api-scan-configuration).
