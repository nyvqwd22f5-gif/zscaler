You must activate any changes made to device control policy rules or endpoint configurations for them to be enforced.
To activate changes made to device control policy rules or configurations:
- Go to **Analytics **> **Endpoint Data Scan** > **Activation**.
- Hover over the **Activation** menu.
- Click **Activate**.
About the Activation Menu
The Activation menu allows you to activate the device control policy rules that you added or edited and also any changes made in the Configuration tab.
The **Activation **menu displays the **Activation Status** for Policy and Configuration changes as follows:
- **No Activations Pending**: When you have activated your changes.
- **Pending Activation**: When you have saved your changes but not activated the changes.
Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) pulls the policy every 15 minutes.
