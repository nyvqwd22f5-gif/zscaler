Groups are used in policies. You can control access to apps based on user groups. For example, you can define groups and policies based on the apps that users are allowed to access. You can create a Facebook-users group and a Twitter-users group, define a policy that allows access to Facebook and apply it to the Facebook-users group, and define another policy that allows access to Twitter and apply it to the Twitter-users group. Users can belong to one or both groups, depending on their business needs. A user can belong to up to 128 groups.
Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision [users](/zia/about-users), groups, and [departments](/zia/about-departments) as described in [About Provisioning and Authentication Methods](/zia/choosing-provisioning-and-authentication-methods). You can also add groups when you configure policies. This article describes how to manage groups on the Groups page as well as provides an overview of its features. You can add up to 140K groups. For a complete list of ranges and limits per feature, see [Ranges & Limitations](/zia/ranges-limitations).
Groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage access policies for group members.
- Categorize your users based on your organization's configuration requirements.
On the Groups page, groups are listed as view-only with limited options (i.e., download group data and search for groups) if you're subscribed to the ZIdentity service. The groups for the ZIA service can be configured in the [ZIdentity Admin Portal](/zidentity/accessing-and-navigating-zidentity-admin-portal). To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
