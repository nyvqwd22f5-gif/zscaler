In the ZIA Admin Portal, you can often edit, delete, or duplicate items you've configured. For example, you can do so with policy rules and other administrative items you've configured in the ZIA Admin Portal (e.g., users and locations).
Editing Items
To edit items:
- Go to the item you want to edit. In this example, it is a location.

If you duplicate a rule, the newly created rule is identical to the existing one, with the exception of the value in the Rule Order field. The new rule shows the next available rule order value.
The process for duplicating (cloning) DLP dictionaries is different. To learn more, see [Cloning Predefined DLP Dictionaries](/zia/cloning-predefined-dlp-dictionaries) and [Cloning DLP Engines](/zia/cloning-predefined-dlp-dictionaries).
