The App Inventory supports many different filters, enabling you to review your apps according to relevant criteria (e.g., Permission Level, Risk Score, etc.).
You can apply more than one filter to your inventory. Each filter includes a drop-down menu with options for further refinement. You can click **More** to search for and select additional filters.

You can reset the filters to view all apps in your inventory. If you want to save a specific filter configuration for later use, you can create a custom view. To learn more, see [Custom Views](/zia/custom-views).
