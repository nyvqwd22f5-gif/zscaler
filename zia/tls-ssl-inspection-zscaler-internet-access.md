The Zscaler Reference Architecture series delivers best practices based on real-world deployments. The recommendations in this series were developed by Zscaler's transformation experts from across the company. This guide will steer you through the architecture process and provide technical deep dives into specific platform functionality and integrations. The Zscaler Reference Architecture series is designed to be modular, so this guide will show you how to configure a different aspect of the platform in order to allow you meet your specific policy goals.
With Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), inspection at scale is not a concern. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) is a platform built to handle full TLS/SSL inspection, based on an advanced proxy architecture. Zscaler recommends inspecting 100% of traffic to protect your users and your organization from threats hiding in encrypted channels. By inspecting all traffic, you gain the benefits of the full ZTE platform. Without inspection, you are blind to many of the threats on the internet today.
