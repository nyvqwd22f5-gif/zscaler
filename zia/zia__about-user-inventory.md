The User Inventory enables you to view and manage all the enabled users in 3rd-Party App Governance. It allows monitoring of all users and offers insights into privileged roles, permissions, and findings for the users.
The User Inventory provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Search for and review a specific user, and filter users by any given criteria (e.g., Role, Platform, Tenant, etc.).
- View user information such as name, email, status, etc., and generate a report.
- View details on all the user activities.
