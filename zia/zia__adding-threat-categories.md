Threat categories group common threats (e.g., viruses, botnets, exploits) together, which can be detected and controlled by Zscaler's signature-based intrusion detection. In addition to the predefined threat categories provided by Zscaler, you can define custom [threat categories](/zia/about-threat-categories) and add [custom IPS signature rules](/zia/about-custom-signature-rules) to them.
To add a custom threat category,
- Go to **Administration **> **Custom IPS**.
- Click the **Threat Categories** tab.
-
Click** Add Threat Category**.
The** Add Threat Category** window appears.
- In the **Add Threat Category **window:
- **Name**: Provide a unique name for the threat category. The name can contain any characters, including spaces, within a character limit of 255.
- **Description**: (Optional) Provide a description for the threat category. The description cannot exceed 255 characters.
- Click **Save **and [activate the change](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
