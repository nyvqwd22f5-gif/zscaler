You can edit a custom root certificate added to your organization at any time, even while it's associated with an isolation profile or a proxy service. The only certificate you cannot edit is the default Zscaler Root Certificate. To learn more, see [About Root Certificates](/zia/about-root-certificates).
To edit a root certificate:
- Go to **Administration** >** Root Certificates**.
- Click the **Edit** icon next to the certificate.
[See image.](#Root-Cert-page_Edit-button)
The **Edit Root Certificate** window appears. In the **Edit Root Certificate** window:
- Edit the **Name** for the root certificate. The PEM file in the certificate cannot be changed. To use a different PEM file, you must [add a new root certificate](/zia/adding-root-certificates).
[See image.](#Edit-Root-Cert-window)
- Edit the **Type** of the root certificate. Use the drop-down menu to change the type of the certificate.
- Click **Done**.

- Click **Save**.
