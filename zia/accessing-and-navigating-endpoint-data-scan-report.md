[]Endpoint Data Scan Report is an analytics and metrics report where in-depth data scan results can be viewed for all the endpoints connected to your organization's user traffic. You can view everyday scan results performed on endpoints by recording and formulating metrics for activities, incidents, and sensitive files discovered for each user in the form of visually intuitive and highly interactive graphs and widgets.
To access the Endpoint Data Scan Report, go to Analytics > Endpoint Data Scan; you're redirected to the Endpoint Data Scan Report pages in a new browser tab.

[]Click **User Investigation** to view scan results and data specific to endpoints connected to a user. You can view the user with the most activities, incidents, department information, risk profile, and other significant metrics. To learn more, see [About User Investigation](/zia/about-user-investigation) and [Analyzing Endpoint DLP Scan for a User](/zia/analyzing-endpoint-dlp-scan-user).
[]Click **Endpoint Data Scan** to view sensitive data stored locally within all the endpoints connected to your organization's traffic. You can view various metrics for each endpoint and the users connected to these endpoints. To learn more, see [About Endpoint Data Scan](/zia/about-endpoint-data-scan).
[]Click **Device Control** to create and manage device control policy rules for removable storage devices (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) and printers to align within specific use cases within your organization. Administrators can define and set up policy rules for the usage of devices based on rule criteria, such as user, department, endpoint, device, etc. To learn more, see [About Device Control](/zia/about-device-control).
[]Click **Inventory **to view information about the devices connected by the end users in the organization and their associated incidents and activities. You can view metrics for each connected device and the users connected to the devices and their endpoints. To learn more, see [About Inventory](/zia/about-inventory).
[]Click **Activation **to enable the device control policy rules that you created in the **Device Control **tab or **Inventory **tab, or any changes made in the **Configuration **tab. To learn more, see [Activating Device Control Policy Rules and Configuration Changes](/zia/activating-device-control-policy-rules-configuration-changes).
[]Click **Configuration **to configure endpoint data scan and other endpoint settings, such as continuous classification and endpoint DLP exemption duration. To learn more, see [Configuring Endpoint Data Scan and Endpoint Settings](/zia/configuring-endpoint-data-scan-endpoint-settings).
[]Click **Account **to view your username, organization name, organization ID, and cloud name.
[]Click **Logout** to log out when you're done analyzing the endpoint scan data.
