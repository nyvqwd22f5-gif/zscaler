There are two ways you can use Zscaler Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) data types and filters to define the Endpoint DLP activities information that you want to view: in a dashboard or report [widget](/zia/what-widget), or when analyzing charts on an Insights page. To learn more about how to analyze your Insights traffic, see [Analyzing Traffic Using Insights](/zia/analyzing-traffic-using-insights).
When you add or edit a widget in a [dashboard](/zia/about-dashboards) or [report](/zia/about-interactive-reports) and select Endpoint DLP in the Widget Settings dialog, you select a data type to view from the Data Type menu and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter drop-down menu.

On the Analytics >** **Endpoint DLP Insights page, you select a data type to view from the menu above the chart and apply filters that you choose from the Add Filter drop-down menu on the left-side pane.

The user and department filters list 200 results at a time. They provide search fields in which you can type a few characters and the results narrow to match your input until you find what you want.
Data Types and Filters
