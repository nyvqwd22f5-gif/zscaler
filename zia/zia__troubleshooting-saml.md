Troubleshooting Browser Settings
The following common issues are encountered due to incorrect user browser settings:
- [Browser Displays "Can't display the webpage." Error Message](#browser-displays-error)
- [Browser Is Stuck on the Redirection Page](#browser-redirection-page)
- [Browser Displays Basic Pop-Up Login](#login-pop-up)
Troubleshooting SAML Error Codes
When a SAML authentication request fails, SAML error codes are displayed in the browser. The following table lists the SAML error codes and troubleshooting tips. A live HTTP header dump is helpful in all cases.

Also, check the relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URI. Ensure that the URI points to the respective organization’s Org-ID on the sso_upd page as shown in the following example:https://login.zscalerbeta.net/sso_upd/3817660In the example, 3817660 is the Org-ID of safemarch.net on the zscalerbeta.net cloud. To see the organization ID, log in to the ZIA Admin Portal and go to **Administration** > **Company Profile**. |
| 0xE550B | The relay state wasn't present in the SAML response, or the relay state is invalid. | Check if the relay state is being sent in the SAML response (sometimes, this happens when REDIRECT binding is configured, instead of POST binding), or check if the response that was sent through Zscaler didn't send the request. |

[]The user's browser displays the error message "Can't display the webpage." This issue can occur if:
- The connection is redirected to Zscaler
- The user's workstation can't connect to the URL
To resolve this issue:
-
Ensure the following exception is present in your PAC file (usually the default PAC file) to make the connection to the server direct, essentially bypassing the Zscaler service:
`if shExpMatch(host, "*.company.tld") return "DIRECT";`
-
Ensure the user's workstation can connect to the remote server with the following command line in a DOS shell:
`telnet <Hostname> 443`
If you get a black screen, then the connection is established.
[]The user’s browser is stuck on the redirection page. If you are seeing the redirection page for more than 10 seconds, then the SAML redirection is looping. This might be due to your explicit proxy configuration. The connection to the server must be direct and not redirected to the Zscaler service
To resolve this issue, add the following exception to your PAC file (usually the default PAC file):
if shExpMatch(host, "*.company.tld") return "DIRECT";
[]The user's browser is displaying a basic pop-up login; authentication isn't transparent. This issue can occur if:
- The user isn't authenticated on the organization’s Federation Identity. To resolve this issue, ensure:
- the user's computer is registered in Active Directory
- the user is logged in to the Windows Domain
- The browser isn't configured to forward the user token to the SAML server: By default, Firefox and Chrome browsers don't relay NTLM tokens to the SAML server. To enable this, do the following:
- **Firefox**: Enter about:config in the address bar, and add the SAML server domain name to the **network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris** option. This allows Firefox to trust the proxy and use NTLM authentication with it.
-
**Chrome**: Enter the following parameter in the command line:
`google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist="*.clientdomain.tld"`
By default, Chrome uses the same parameters as IE, so this settings shouldn't be required in a Windows environment. To learn more, see [HTTP authentication](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/http-authentication).
- **Internet Explorer**: Add the SAML server domain name to the Local intranet security zone.
