You can check if the Zscaler service is placing service access from an IP address on the denylist, due to suspicious traffic activity.
To check if the Zscaler service is placing an IP address on the denylist:
- Hover over the **Help** icon at the bottom of the left pane, then click **Denylist IP Check** to open the **Denylist IP Check** window.
[See image.](#help-denylist)
- Enter the IP address you want to check, and click **Check Denylist**.
The Zscaler service displays the results. If the Zscaler service placed the IP address on the denylist, it displays the IP address with additional comments. If it didn't place the IP address on the denylist, then there are no results.
