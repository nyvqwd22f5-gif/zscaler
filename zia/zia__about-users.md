Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision users, [groups](/zia/about-groups), and [departments](/zia/about-departments) as described in [About Provisioning and Authentication Methods](/zia/choosing-provisioning-and-authentication-methods). This article describes how to manage user accounts on the Users page as well as provides an overview of its features. You can add up to 1400K users. For a complete list of ranges and limits per feature, see [Ranges & Limitations](/zia/ranges-limitations).
Users provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Manage users within your organization who have access to the ZIA service.
- View users enrolled for the ZIA service.
On the Users page, users are listed as view-only with limited options (i.e., download user data and search for users) if you're subscribed to the ZIdentity service. The user for the ZIA service can be configured in the [ZIdentity Admin Portal](/zidentity/accessing-and-navigating-zidentity-admin-portal). To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
