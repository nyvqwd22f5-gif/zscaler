When a file is quarantined, a tombstone file is created to give the user an idea of why this happened. You are able to customize tombstone file templates and can reference one of them when configuring the malware and DLP detection policy rules. To learn more, see [Configuring the SaaS Security API Malware Detection Policy](/zia/configuring-saas-security-api-malware-detection-policy).
The tombstone file templates provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create a custom message that provides users with information about why their file was quarantined.
- Associate the tombstone file templates with DLP or malware policy rules.
