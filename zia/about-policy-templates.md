A policy template is a customizable document that includes your organization's policies and ensures consistency between policies. Policies of an organization can include purpose, definition, scope, limitations, and actions to be taken. The Zscaler partners can have multiple policy templates created and have them applied to the tenant's account.
Policy templates provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Create a new policy template for individual tenants or tenant groups.
- Edit or delete an existing policy template.
- Edit a policy template on ZIA. For example, policy changes made to Policy Template-1 are visible on the Template-1 account in the ZIA Admin Portal.
About the Policy Template Page
On the Policy Template page, you can do the following:
- [Add a policy template](/zia/adding-policy-template).
- View a list of all the policy templates configured. For each policy template, you can see:
- **Name**: The name of the policy template.
- **No. of Tenants**: The total number of tenants assigned with the same policy template.
- **Description**: The description of the policy template.
- **Actions**: The actions provisioned for the selected policy template. The actions available are **Edit**, **Delete**, and** Edit Policy Template in ZIA**.
-
[Delete a policy template.](/zia/editing-items)
Deleting a policy template removes that policy template from the Management Portal for Partners (MPP) database, but the configured template and policies are available in the ZIA policy configurations. When you delete a policy template in the MPP, the ZIA admin gets full access to that template (initially accessible as read-only), so that the template under the ZIA tenant can be managed (edit, reorder, or leave as such) by the ZIA admin.
