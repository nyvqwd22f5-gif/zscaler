Zscaler provides a number of ways to provision users, [groups](/zia/about-groups), and [departments](/zia/about-departments) as described in [About Provisioning and Authentication Methods](/zia/choosing-provisioning-and-authentication-methods). This article describes how to delete individual user accounts on the Users page in the ZIA Admin Portal.
To delete a user:
- Go to **Administration **>** User Management**.

- [Activate the change](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
When you create an admin (Administration > Administrator Management), a corresponding user is also created in the User Management page (Administration > User Management). The Delete option is not available for these user entries. To delete such user entries, you must delete the corresponding admin accounts. To learn more, see [Deleting ZIA Admins](/zia/deleting-zia-admins).
