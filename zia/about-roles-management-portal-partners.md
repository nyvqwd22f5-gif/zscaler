Zscaler Management Portal for Partners provides a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) feature that allows you to create and customize admin role templates as required.
A role template in the Management Portal for Partners can allow or restrict access to different function modules of the portal as defined by the admin.
For example, a role template can provide full access to the Tenants page but view-only access to Policy Templates. Another role template can provide permissions to edit admins while not giving permissions to view the tenants, and so on.
The Roles page provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Create customized RBAC templates for different function modules in the Management Portal for Partners.
- Create customized RBAC templates for products managed by the Management Portal for Partners.
- Assign role templates to different admin users as needed.
