Roles determine the sets of tasks that users can perform across the 3rd-Party App Governance Admin Portal based on the permissions.
Roles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Configure role-based access control by assigning predefined roles to users in your organization.
- Control user access to different modules.
3rd-Party App Governance provides the following set of predefined roles and permissions that can be assigned to users:
- **Admin**: The default super admin role with the highest level of privilege that has full access across the platform, including user management, policy editing, integrations, and security actions.
- **User**: The user can perform key operational actions like editing policies, uploading apps, exporting data, and acknowledging findings, but cannot manage platform-wide settings or integrations.
- **Viewer**: The user can view data across the platform and export reports, but cannot take any action or make changes.
