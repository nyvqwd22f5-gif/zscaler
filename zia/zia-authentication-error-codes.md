[]The following table lists the error codes that the Zscaler service displays when user authentication fails:
| Error Code | Description | What to Do |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 211000 | This error occurs when gateway redirected traffic is forwarded from a location where authentication is disabled. | Check if you have different routing for the gateway redirected traffic and the actual traffic. |
| 421000 | This error occurs when the organization's information extracted from the user cookie does not match the organization's DPPC port used for forwarding traffic. | Clear the cookies and try again. If the error persists, export logs and contact Zscaler Support. |

The following troubleshooting guidelines and tips are for the Active Directory (AD) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) synchronization errors.
Unable to Synchronize with a Directory Server
If you're unable to synchronize with a directory server:
- Verify the connectivity between the Zscaler Central Authority (CA) server and the directory server
- Verify that the BIND password is correct
A User Is Unable to Authenticate
If a user's password is changed on the AD or LDAP server but the user is still using the old password, you can do the following to resolve this issue:
- Reset the password on the AD or LDAP server
- Check the error code
The following table lists the error codes that the Zscaler service displays when it can't authenticate a user:
| Error Code | Description | When It Occurs | What to Do |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 100 | The ldapsearch couldn't be done against the directory. | Invalid LDAP filter. | Check the LDAP search filter in the Zscaler service portal and ensure the syntax is correct. Verify if the same filter works with the ldapsearch. |
| 101 | Incorrect password. | Incorrect login password. | Correct the password. |
| 102 | The LDAP connection closed. | The server closed the connection unexpectedly. | Retry. This should only be a transient error. |
| 103 | The user wasn't found on the LDAP servers (search failed). | The ldapsearch for the user failed. The search may be done using "email" or "username" based on advanced search status. | Check if a manual ldapsearch returns the user with the same query as the one configured in the ZIA Admin Portal. |
| 104 | The user's DN couldn't be found. | The user's DN couldn't be read due to LDAP library issues. | Consult your LDAP admin. |
| 105 | Error performing a BIND with the user's credentials. | The DN may be invalid. | Check if a manual BIND works with the same user credentials. |
| 106 | Internal error. | A deleted user tried to log in. | Check if the user is in the list of synchronized users. Synchronize the users. |
| 108 | The LDAP context wasn't found. | A user in a second directory tried to log in when there was no secondary LDAP configuration. | Zscaler must "unset" flags in the DB for secondary users or do a sync-preview sync once for your organization. |
| 109 | The synchronization is in progress. Users are not allowed to log in. | A user tried to log in during the synchronization. | Wait until the synchronization is completed. |
| 110 | The LDAP bind failed. | The admin's LDAP bind password may be wrong. | Check the password. |
| 111 | Internal error. | Internal error. | Retry or contact Zscaler Support. |
| 112 | The advanced search query couldn't be sent. | Your organization is using an advanced search query for logins, and there's a problem with the advanced search filter used. | Check the advanced search filter. Ensure that ldapsearch returns users with the same filter. |
| 113 | The user wasn't found in the list of synchronized users. | The user is not in the list of synchronized users. | Synchronize the user data and retry. |
| 114 | Login failed. The connection to the directory server was reset. | The connection to the directory server was reset. | Retry. |
| 115 | Login failed. The configuration changed. | An admin activated new configuration settings in the ZIA Admin Portal. | Retry. |
| 116 | Login failed. The user was deleted. | A deleted user tried to log in. | Check if the user is in the list of synchronized users. Synchronize the user data and retry. |

If Kerberos authentication fails, the Zscaler service displays a page with an error code. The following table lists the information on the Kerberos authentication error codes. For instructions on how to troubleshoot Kerberos, see [Troubleshooting Kerberos](/zia/troubleshooting-kerberos).
[](/zia/what-my-cloud-name-zia)
[](/zia/kerberos-configuration-example-trust-relationship-windows-server-2012-and-gpo-push#create-new-trust)
| Error Code | Description | When It Occurs | What to Do |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 391000 | The page cannot load. | Generic error code. | Contact Zscaler Support. |
| 441000, 461000 | The user cannot be found. | The user was deleted or cannot be found in the registered domain. | Add the user. |
| 451000 | The domain does not exist. | The realm is not a registered domain on the Zscaler service. | Contact Zscaler support to add the realm as a registered domain. |
| 471000
(Occurrence 1) | The proxy authorization header does not contain the encoded Kerberos ticket. In almost all cases, this means that NTLM was used. | The traffic was sent to the ZIA Public Service Edge IP address. The default Zscaler PAC file was used instead of the Kerberos PAC file.
**Symptoms**: klist does not show either the ZIA Public Service Edge or KDC tickets. | Change the PAC file. Ensure that you use the Kerberos PAC file. |
| 471000
(Occurrence 2) |  | The user's computer does not have the GPO updates, the GPO updates are not on the domain controller, or the user is not logged in to the domain.
**Symptoms**: A traffic capture from the user's computer does not show any query to the domain controller for the Zscaler ticket. | Verify the registry settings to ensure the user's computer has the Zscaler Kerberos settings. If they are not on the computer, verify that the domain controller has the GPO configurations.
Verify that the user is logged in to the domain. |
| 471000
(Occurrence 3) |  | AES encryption is not enabled in the realm trust on the domain controller.
**Symptoms**: klist does not show either the ZIA Public Service Edge or KDC tickets.
A traffic capture shows the domain controller returning ETYPE_NOSUPP errors. | Modify the realm trust relationship and ensure that the AES encryption option is selected. |
| 471000
(Occurrence 4) |  | The realm trust relationship is not configured on the domain controller or the realm trust was configured with an incorrect password.
**Symptoms**: klist does not show the Zscaler KDC or ZIA Public Service Edge tickets.
A traffic capture shows the domain controller returning PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN error. | Verify the realm trust configuration. Ensure that the realm name is in upper case and that the Zscaler cloud name is correct. To learn how you can find your cloud name, see What is my cloud name for ZIA?
If they are both correct, then the passwords in the organization's realm and the Zscaler realm might not match. Log in to the ZIA Admin Portal, regenerate the trust password, and copy it. On the domain controller, delete the trust configuration and create a new one as described in Kerberos Trust Relationship Configuration Guide for Windows Server 2012 and GPO Push. Ensure that you use the newly generated password that you copied from the ZIA Admin Portal. |
| 471000
(Occurrence 5) |  | The user's computer cannot connect to the domain controller.
**Symptoms**: When you run klist purge to clear the tickets, refresh the browser, and then run klist again, Kerberos tickets are not displayed, including those of the domain controller. | Verify that the computer can contact the domain controller.
If the user is using DirectAccess, run netsh name show effectivepolicy to determine if the DirectAccess client considers the workstation as being in the intranet or outside |
| 48100 | Invalid encoding of Kerberos credentials. | Possible header corruption. Ensure that there is no intermediate proxy or L7 device that may be corrupting the header. | Contact Zscaler Support. |
| 491000, 501000
(Occurrence 1) | Invalid Kerberos token or username. | The computer time is incorrect. | Kerberos is very sensitive to clocks being in sync. Ensure that computer time is correct and it synchronizes with an NTP server. |
| 491000, 501000
(Occurrence 2) |  | Other issues. | Contact Zscaler Support. |
| 510000 | The user name is too long. | The user's login name exceeds the maximum allowed characters. | Contact Zscaler Support. |
