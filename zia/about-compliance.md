Organization cloud infrastructure is deployed on multiple cloud service providers catering to a global customer base. This leads to a huge set of compliance standards which organizations need to uphold. ZPC enables organizations to monitor their cloud compliance posture against multiple compliance benchmarks.
ZPC also compiles the policies offered in all the benchmarks and offers a Zscaler Best Practices benchmark for you to gauge your compliance across all available benchmarks. To view all benchmarks supported by ZPC, see [Supported Benchmarks](/zpc/supported-benchmarks).
The compliance page provides the following benefits and enable you to:
- View your cloud infrastructure's compliance posture against industry standard and custom-made created benchmarks.
- View and manage compliance ignore rules to monitor relevant resources.
- View all the benchmarks offered by ZPC.
