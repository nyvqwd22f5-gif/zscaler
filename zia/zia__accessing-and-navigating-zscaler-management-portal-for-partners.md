This article covers the following topics to help you get started with the Zscaler Management Portal for Partners:
- [Accessing the Management Portal](#accessanagementportal)
- [Navigating within the Management Portal](#navigatingmanagementportal)
- [Maintenance and Upgrade](#maintenance)
[]Zscaler Support configures a default admin role, which has access to all the functions in the Management Portal, and sends you an email requesting the password be reset for that role. After you reset that password, you can access the [Management Portal](https://partners.zscalerscm.net/#/login).
To access the management portal:
- Enter your **Login ID** and **Password**.
- Select **Remember my Login ID **if you want the Management Portal to remember your username the next time you log in.
- From the drop-down menu, select the language in which you want to use the portal. By default, **English (US) **is selected.
- Click **Sign In**.
