Your organization must configure your corporate firewall to allow for remote access:
- If the Private Service Edges are deployed in the DMZ of your organization or behind the network firewall. To learn more, see [Deploying Private Service Edge](/zia/deploying-service-edge).
- If your organization uses PAC files to forward traffic from your internal network to the Private Service Edges.
To review your firewall configuration requirements, as well as cloud enforcement node ranges:
- Log in to the ZIA Admin Portal.
- Go to **Help** > **Cloud Configuration Requirements**.
