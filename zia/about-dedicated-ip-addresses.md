To enable the Dedicated IP feature for your ZIA tenant, contact your Zscaler Account team.
The IP Addresses page displays the IP addresses that are dedicated to your organization provisioned by Zscaler. Zscaler provisions these IP addresses at the data centers you choose. You can use the IP address dedicated to your tenant as the source IP address for the traffic that egresses through the Zscaler cloud.
The IP Addresses page provides the following benefits and enables you to view and download the IP addresses that are dedicated to your organization at the Zscaler data centers that you chose.
