You can subscribe to Cloud NSS, enabling direct cloud-to-cloud log streaming for [all ZIA log types](/zia/adding-cloud-nss-feeds) into a compatible cloud-based security information and event management (SIEM) system without any on-premises connectors. Instead of deploying, managing, and monitoring NSS VMs, you can configure an HTTPS API feed to push logs from the Zscaler cloud into an HTTPS API-based log collector on your SIEM. To learn more, see [Understanding Nanolog Streaming Service (NSS)](/zia/understanding-nanolog-streaming-service).
