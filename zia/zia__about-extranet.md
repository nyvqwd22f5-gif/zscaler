Zscaler Extranet Application Support allows Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) users to access private applications hosted on a business partner's network, and it gives partners access to secured applications on your organization's network, eliminating the need to install any application connectors on the partner's network or connect a data center to the partner. With Zscaler Extranet Application Support, your organization's partners can establish [IPSec tunnels](/zia/configuring-ipsec-vpn-tunnel) directly to the Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE). Extranets are created and assigned to [locations](/zia/about-locations) in the ZIA Admin Portal. After an extranet location is configured in ZIA, a ZPA admin can use it to configure [server groups](/zpa/configuring-server-groups) and [application segments](/zpa/configuring-application-segments), which can be managed with [ZPA access policies](/zpa/configuring-access-policies). To learn more, see [Understanding Extranet Application Support](/zia/understanding-extranet-application-support).
Extranet Application Support is not enabled by default. To access Extranet Application Support, contact your Zscaler Account team.
Extranet Application Support provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Securely access partner resources that are not integrated with the Zscaler service.
- Allow partners to access applications on your organization's network securely.
- View [insights](/zia/about-insights) and [insights logs](/zia/about-insights-logs) for configured extranets.
- Manage access to extranet resources with ZPA.
