Zscaler allows for granular control of the authentication timeout on a per-location basis. You can create and manage custom authentication profiles on this page. To learn more, see [Configuring Custom Authentication Timeout Profiles](/zia/configuring-custom-authentication-timeout-profiles).
This feature is in limited availability. To access this feature, contact your Zscaler Account team.
Authentication profiles provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Control the authentication timeout in your organization on a per-location basis.
- Manage up to 8 profiles with a frequency range of 5 minutes to 999 days.
The Authentication Profiles page is unavailable if you're subscribed to the ZIdentity service. To learn more, see [What Is ZIdentity?](/zidentity/what-zidentity)
