You can define time intervals for use in policies. For example, if you want to block users from accessing shopping sites from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays, you can create a time interval called Weekdays that includes Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
To define time intervals:
- Do one of the following:
- Go to **Administration **>** ****Time Intervals**, then click **Add Time Interval**.

The **Add Time Interval** window appears.
- In the **Add Time Interval **window:
- **Name**: Enter a name to identify the time interval.
- **Every Day**: To choose all days of the week, enable this option. If you disable this option, you can choose which days of the week apply to the time interval.
- **All Day**: To choose all day as the time period, enable this option. If you disable this option, you can choose the time period that applies to the time interval. Only one time period can be set at a time.
- Click **Save** and [activate the change](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
