The Redaction page lets you add, view, and configure redaction profiles to enforce rights management for your organization. You can use redaction profiles as part of your SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy to hide sensitive content that triggers policy rules.
When configuring SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning DLP policy rules, you can use the redaction profiles you create to add redaction characters to multiple file types. To learn more, see [Adding and Editing Redaction Profiles](/zia/adding-editing-redaction-profiles).
The Redaction page provides the following benefits and allows you to:
- Add, view, and configure redaction profiles for your organization.
- Make redaction profiles available to be used on multiple file types as part of your SaaS Security Data at Rest Scanning DLP policy.
