An organization can create up to 500 custom reports shared across all administrators. Depending on your organization's subscriptions, you can create reports that provide information about web, mobile traffic, or a combination of both. Each report can display up to 20 [widgets](/zia/about-widgets).
You can create new reports from scratch, copy standard reports, or [import](/zia/exporting-importing-reports) reports.
To learn more about the Interactive Reports page, see [About Interactive Reports](/zia/about-interactive-reports).
Creating a New Report
To create a new report:
- Go to **Analytics** > **Interactive Reports**.
- Click **New Report** > **Create New**.
The **New Report** window appears with a list of report data classes.
- In the** New Report** window, choose the data class you want your report to fall under, and click **OK**:
- Web
- Mobile
- Firewall
- DNS
- Email DLP
- Combined
- To create your new report:
- Enter the report’s name. The report title must be unique, and it can contain up to 75 characters.
- Add a report description.
- Choose a time frame. You can choose a predefined time frame or select **Custom** to set the start date and time. When you set a custom time frame:
- The start date cannot be earlier than January 1, 2012.
- The maximum time range is 90 days.
- You can set the time frame for all widgets in your report or select **Allow time to be set for each widget** to set a different time frame for each widget. You can change this option at any time.
- Optionally, define report-level filters. You can set report-level filters, as well as widget-level filters. The filters at the report level can restrict the data types available at the widget level, and the list of available filters narrows down, based on the combination. Some data types are mutually exclusive, so you won't see all the data types all the time. For example, if you set the **Department** filter at the report level, **Location** will no longer be available at the widget level. Similarly, the filters at the widget level also narrow down the remaining filter list at the report level.

- Click **Add Widget** to add a widget and define the widget settings. You can also edit or remove widgets. To learn more, see [About Widgets](/zia/about-widgets).
- Once you add a widget, you will see a gray **Add** icon on the right side. When you click on it, you can add a section name.

- Once you add a section name, you can hover over it and a **Delete** icon will appear, alongside **Up** and **Down** arrows. When you click on the **Delete** icon, you'll delete the section name. If you have multiple sections, the **Up** and **Down** arrows will allow you to move any section above or below other sections.
