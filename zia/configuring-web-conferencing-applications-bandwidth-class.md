[Bandwidth classes](/zia/about-bandwidth-classes) identify the [URL categories](/zia/about-url-categories) and [cloud applications](/zia/about-cloud-app-control) to which the service allocates bandwidth. You can group URL categories or applications into bandwidth classes, and then reference them in [Bandwidth Control](/zia/about-bandwidth-control) policy rules.
The **Web Conferencing Applications** tab lists the web conferencing applications that can be included in this class.
To specify the applications belong to this bandwidth class:
- Go to **Administration **>** Bandwidth Classes **to [manage bandwidth classes](/zia/adding-bandwidth-classes).
- Go to the **Web Conferencing Applications **tab.
- Enable or disable applications as necessary.
- Click **Save** and [activate the changes](/zia/saving-and-activating-changes-admin-portal).
