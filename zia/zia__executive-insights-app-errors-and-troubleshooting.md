Contact support if you have any further questions. | In the ZIA Admin Portal, ensure that the user exists and is assigned a role with permission to access the Executive Insights App. |
| Invalid Email Entry | The user gets the following error message on the Login screen:You have entered an invalid email. Please try again. | The user must enter their correct email address. |
| Missing Confirmation Code Email | The user is waiting on the Confirmation Code screen but has not received an email containing the confirmation code. | Check whether the countdown timer "Resend in XX seconds" has started on the Confirmation Code screen. If you see the countdown timer, it implies that the API call to send the confirmation code was successful and that the email had been sent from the back end to the user. To resolve this issue further:The user must check their spam folder for emails with the confirmation code.If the user has not received the Confirmation Code email, the user must click the **Resend Code** button, wait until the countdown timer starts, and then check their email inbox for a new email with the code. |
| Invalid Confirmation Code | The user has entered the confirmation code but the following error message displays:Validation failed. Please re-enter the correct confirmation code or have a new one sent. | To resolve this issue:The user must verify that the confirmation code entered is correct.The user clicks **Resend Code** to generate a new confirmation code.It is recommended that users wait to receive the confirmation code instead of clicking the **Resend Code** button multiple times.

| Contact IT Admin for Access | Some users can log in to the app successfully but get the following error:Contact your IT admin to provide you access to a tenant. | This issue happens only in the case of ZIdentity-based authentication. If the user has been given a ZIdentity role with permission to access the Executive Insights App but has not been given access to the ZIA Administration Management for any tenant, ensure the following:In the ZIA Admin Portal, under Administration > Administration Management:The user exists.The user has a role with permission to access the Executive Insights App. |
| Stuck on Select Tenant Screen | The user is able to log in to the app successfully but is unable to see their specific tenant organization on the Select Tenant screen. | In the ZIA Admin Portal of that specific tenant organization, under Administration > Administration Management, ensure that the user exists and is assigned a role with permission to access the Executive Insights App. |

| No Data in Widgets | The following message displays on some widgets:No Data | Try changing the filters. For example, you can change the time range selection (Last 7 Days, Last 14 Days, etc.) or any widget-specific filter.If the error message still displays, no further action is required. It is possible that no data is available for that tenant for the selected time range. The data would start showing up when it becomes available. |
| Wrong Data in Widgets | The data on the Executive Insights App does not match with the data in the admin portals of ZIA, Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), or Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX). | To resolve this issue:Verify that the user has selected the correct tenant on the Profile screen.Close the app, clear the app data, and restart the app. This sequence forces the latest data to be fetched from the back end.Confirm that the user is not using the Demo mode, as it contains mock data. |
| Stale Data in Widgets | The app is not showing the latest data. | To fetch the latest data, close the app, clear the app data, and restart the app. This sequence forces the latest data to be fetched from the back end.The Executive Insights App data refreshes once a day (i.e., the data for today is visible only tomorrow). |
| Stale Data in Widgets (includes timing discrepancies) | When the Last X Days filter is applied, data older than two days is shown instead of data until the previous day. | Data refreshes once a day starting at the UTC day boundary (00:00 UTC). Users in UTC+ time zones continue to see data that is two days older until their local time crosses the UTC day boundary. For example, in India (UTC+05:30), users cannot see data for the previous day until 05:30 hrs (Indian time). Additionally, even after the UTC boundary is crossed, it might take a few hours for the data to be processed and analyzed before being made available to users. For instance, if data processing takes approximately two hours, users in India might not see the previous day’s data until around 07:30 hrs (Indian time). Note that this is an illustrative example, and the processing time can vary depending on system load and other factors. |
| Missing Time Range Selection on Screens | The Time Range is not available in:The Risk360 screenThe Experience screen | ZDX and Risk360 products support only the most current data and fixed time ranges. Hence, the app does not provide any option to select time ranges for these screens. |

| Subscription Required Message | The user sees "Subscription Required" message on some of the widgets instead of the actual data. | Widgets are rendered based on the subscriptions included for the user's tenant.To check the ZDX subscriptions for the tenant, go to the Profile screen and check the bottom line. |
| Demo Mode on Risk360 Screen | No data displays on the Risk360 screen, and only an option to start the Demo mode is available. | The tenant must be provisioned on Risk360 before any data for that tenant would start showing up on the Risk360 screen. Until then, the tenant users can only see the Demo mode. |

| Sandbox Threat Widget Behavior | The month value on the Sandbox Threat widget is not always selectable. | Zscaler Sandbox threats data is aggregated monthly, which happens at the end of the month. If you select the **Last 7**, **Last 14**, or **Last 30 Days** filter, you can only see last month's data. When you select **Last 90 Days**, you can select any of the past three months for which you want to see the data.You can see the data only for those months when some threats were detected. There might not have been any threats in a month, in which case that specific month does not show up on the selection. |
| Stuck on Loader for an Extended Time | After successfully logging in, the user is unable to select the tenant on the Select Tenant screen and an error is shown. | The app tries to determine the subscriptions included for the tenant on the Select Tenant screen, which might fail due to network connectivity issues or reachability of the API endpoint. To resolve this issue:Check the network connectivity from the user's phone. If the user is using Zscaler Client Connector on the phone, then make sure that Private Access is turned on and that authentication has not expired.In rare cases, if there are reachability issues with the API endpoint, the user must retry selecting the tenant. |
