The ZDX Setup Wizard allows Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) admins to quickly enable the ZDX service and get started with ZDX applications. ZIA admins can also add the ZDX admin role to other existing ZIA admins or new admins.
If you already have ZIA admin and policy access, you'll be alerted within the ZIA notification panel that the wizard is available if ZDX is not already configured. If you invite new admins to manage ZDX, they'll be notified by email that they're eligible for the ZDX admin role.
Invited admins must contact the inviter for a login password.
