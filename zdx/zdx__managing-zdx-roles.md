You can add, edit, delete, or view a ZDX Role in the ZDX Admin Portal depending on what permission levels you have. ZDX Roles to which you have Full access are indicated by the **Edit** and **Delete **icon. If you have View Only access, then the ZDX Role shows a **View** icon and you cannot edit or delete them.
The Role Management page (Administration > Administration Controls > Role Management) allows you to perform the following actions:
- [Add a ZDX Role](/zdx/adding-zdx-roles)
- [Edit a ZDX Role](#EditingRole)
- [Delete a ZDX Role](#DeletingRole)
- [View a ZDX Role](#ViewRole)
You cannot edit or delete a predefined role (e.g., Super Admin).
