The ZDX Service Desk Role is a predefined role and can support the following goals:
- Seeks to exceed supported Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
- Reduce escalations, cost, and time spent per ticket.
- Rapidly resolve user-reported issues caused by devices, networks, and applications by using ZDX.
- Proactively alert users of outages and slowdowns before complaints arise.
The ZDX Service Desk Role is divided into different tiers. Each tier allows the admin varying levels of access based on the permissions assigned. To learn more, see [Adding ZDX Roles](/zdx/adding-zdx-roles) and [About ZDX Role-Based Administration](/zdx/about-zdx-role-based-administration).
Tier 1 has the following permissions:
- User Name
When an admin has access to User Name, then the admin can access User Search.
- User Dashboard
