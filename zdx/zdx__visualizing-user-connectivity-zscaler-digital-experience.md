The Zscaler Reference Architecture series delivers best practices based on real-world deployments. The recommendations in this series were developed by Zscaler's transformation experts from across the company. This guide will steer you through the architecture process and provide technical deep dives into specific platform functionality and integrations. The Zscaler Reference Architecture series is designed to be modular, so this guide will show you how to configure a different aspect of the platform in order to allow you meet your specific policy goals.
Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) provides visibility into the experience for your end user. ZDX delivers Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) via Zscaler Client Connector, a small agent that probes the device itself. Zscaler Client Connector sends probes to cloud applications you define and performs network health checks from your client devices. ZDX also proactively alerts you to problems that are occurring.
