Departments categorize users into different units. Departments were created in the [ZIA Admin Portal](/zia/about-departments) and are seen in the ZDX Admin Portal. Departments are used to help identify which users are impacted in dashboards and reports. You can configure [alerts](/zdx/configuring-alert-rule) specific to departments to notify you when they are experiencing a decrease in real-time user experience.
Departments provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- View your organization's defined departments from the ZIA Admin Portal for easy identification by searching for or managing department details.
- Export a list of departments into a CSV file for your own reporting use.
