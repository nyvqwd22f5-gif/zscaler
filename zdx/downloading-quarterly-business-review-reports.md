The Quarterly Business Review (QBR) report provides extensive insight into how Zscaler is helping protect your network, quarter to quarter. The reports can help you observe emerging traffic trends and the types of threats that Zscaler is blocking. To learn more, see [Viewing Quarterly Business Review Reports](/zdx/viewing-quarterly-business-review-reports).
A new QBR report is generated on the first weekend of every month, and each report is securely stored as a PowerPoint file in the Zscaler cloud. These reports are available to ZDX users of all ZDX subscription levels. If you don't see the reports, contact your support team or open a Zscaler Support ticket to have it enabled.
You must have a minimum of 100 active devices for 30 days to generate and view QBR reports.
You can download and view the reports from the left-side navigation of the ZDX Admin Portal:
- Go to **Analytics **> **Quarterly Business Reviews**.
- Click the **Download **icon within the table to download a specific report.
Use the search field if you're unable to find a report. Search for any character string that might be part of the report name or time period.
