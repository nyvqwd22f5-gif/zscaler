Groups categorize users into different admin groups. The groups were created in the ZIA Admin Portal and are seen in the ZDX Admin Portal. To learn more, see Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA)'s [About Groups](/zia/about-groups).
Groups provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Identify your organization's groups from the ZIA Admin Portal.
