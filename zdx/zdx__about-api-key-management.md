API Key Management is a repository for an organization to store created API keys for admin roles. An API key consists of an API Key ID and Secret. These two items are required for access to ZDX APIs.
API Key Management provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Provide a repository of generated, authorized API keys for programmatic access to ZDX API.
- Maintain the configuration of API keys by creating, viewing, editing, or deleting the API keys as required.
- Identify the life cycle of an API key to maintain security.
If you need to obtain API keys or secrets to access [Zscaler OneAPI](/oneapi) endpoints, see [About API Clients](/zidentity/about-api-clients) in ZIdentity.
