Zscaler uses integrations to provide visibility and security for SaaS applications used in your organization. You can authorize SaaS applications with Zscaler by adding them as tenants. In ZDX, you can configure an integration to a tenant for data collection, Workflow Automation, or webhooks.
Integration provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Configure integrations (e.g., Microsoft Intune) for data collection to access Endpoint Analytics.
- Create Workflow Automations by authenticating Zscaler access to SaaS Tenants.
- Configure webhooks to create alert notifications.
