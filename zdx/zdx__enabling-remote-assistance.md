At times, Zscaler Support might need access to your organization's Admin Portal for a limited period to troubleshoot issues. With Remote Assistance, you can allow Zscaler Support to securely and remotely log in to your ZDX Admin Portal. This can be done with either view-only or full [admin](/zdx/managing-zdx-admins) access. You do not need to create new admin accounts or share passwords to enable access for either option.
To enable remote assistance:
- Log in to the ZDX Admin Portal.
- Go to **Help **>** Remote Assistance**.
The **Remote Assistance** window appears.
- In the **Remote Assistance** window:
- **Enable View-Only Access** and/or **Enable** **Full Access: **Enable either access option or both.
- If you select **Enable View-Only Access**, the **View-Only Access Enabled Until** field appears. Select the amount of time you want the access enabled. The length of time for view-only access cannot exceed 90 days. This procedure allows Zscaler Support to access the ZDX Admin Portal until the specified date.
- If you select **Enable Full Access**, the **Full Access Enabled Until** field appears. Select the amount of time you want the access enabled. Zscaler recommends that you select a length of at least two days when choosing full access. The length of time for full access cannot exceed 90 days. This procedure allows Zscaler Support to access the ZDX Admin Portal until the specified date.
