To help you find users quickly, you can use Search in the ZDX Admin Portal. Search is available by Users and Devices.
To search in the ZDX Admin Portal:
- Hover over the **Search** icon in the left-side navigation menu. The search panel appears.

- Select **Users** or **Devices**.
- Enter your search text:
- **Users**: Enter an email or name to search for a user.
- **Devices**: Enter a device hostname to search for a device.
The ZDX Admin Portal automatically activates the cursor in the search bar, so you don't need to click before typing.
- The first 10 most relevant results are displayed. Click the **Load More** button to display 10 more results consecutively until complete. If there are fewer than 10 results, the **Load More** button does not display.

- Click the relevant name or email to view the user details page for that user. To learn more, see [Evaluating User Details](/zdx/evaluating-user-details).
If a user profile was recently deleted, that profile is displayed in the search results. Clicking the deleted user profile and accessing the user page also indicates that the profile is deleted. For data retention limits on user information, see [Ranges and Limitations](/zdx/ranges-limitations).
The **Search** keeps a history of the last 5 users whose details you viewed. If a deleted user profile was part of the search history, that is also indicated.
