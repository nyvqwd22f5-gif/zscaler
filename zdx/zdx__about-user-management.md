To access User Management, the admin must have their User Management permission set to **View Only**. To learn more, see [Adding ZDX Roles](/zdx/adding-zdx-roles).
Zscaler records relevant user information (e.g., User ID or name, Groups, Department, etc.) for each user that is assigned an admin role on the User Management page on the ZDX Admin Portal.
User Management provides the following benefits and enables you to:
- Gather a list of granular user details such as user name, group, department, and status.
- Search for a user.
- Export a list of users into a CSV file.
