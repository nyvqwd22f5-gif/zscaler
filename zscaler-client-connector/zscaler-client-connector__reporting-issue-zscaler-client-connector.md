This article covers how to access the **Report an Issue** form and complete the form on different OSs. When you submit the form, depending on your organization's setup, Zscaler Client Connector might send an email to your organization's support admin or submit a ticket directly to Zscaler Support (your support admin receives a copy of this ticket as well).

The **Report an Issue **option** **appears in the app user interface only if your IT admin has [enabled it in your Zscaler Client Connector support configuration](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-user-access-support-options-zscaler-client-connector).
