You can copy an existing [Zscaler Client Connector Profile](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-zscaler-client-connector-profiles) and change the settings to customize the profile to fit your needs instead of having to configure each setting in a profile. By duplicating an existing profile, you can test a profile before deploying it to reduce mistakes.
To copy a Zscaler Client Connector App Profile:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **App Profiles**.
- In the left-side navigation, click the platform from where you want to copy the profile.
- Click the **Copy **icon next to the profile you want to copy.
