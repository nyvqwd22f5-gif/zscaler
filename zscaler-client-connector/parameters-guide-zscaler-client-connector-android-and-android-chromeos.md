| Parameter | Description | Value | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- |
| userDomain | Your organization's domain name. If your instance has multiple domains associated with it, enter the primary domain for your instance.The primary domain is only valid if you are using a single IdP with multiple domains. The primary domain won’t work if you have multiple domains across multiple IdPs. | Example: `safemarch.com`Specify the exact domain that is present in the SAML NameID field. For example, if your user’s NameID is john.doe@corp.company.com, then enter `corp.company.com`. | This install option allows users to skip the app enrollment page. If single sign-on is enabled for your organization, users are taken directly to your organization's SSO login page. |
| cloudName | The name of the cloud on which your organization is provisioned. To learn more, see What Is My Cloud Name for ZIA?If your organization is provisioned on more than one cloud, your users are asked to select the cloud where their traffic is sent during the enrollment process. With this install option, you can specify the cloud where the app sends user traffic, so your users don't have to make the selection during enrollment. | If your cloud name is zscalertwo.net, enter `zscalertwo`. | Do not use this option if your organization is provisioned on one cloud. The app automatically sends traffic to the proper cloud and your users don't need to make a selection during enrollment. |
| deviceToken | The appropriate device token from the Zscaler Client Connector Portal if you want to use the Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. The Zscaler service silently provisions and authenticates users even if you don't have an authentication mechanism in place. | Example: `123456677754` | This option applies only to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). It is not supported by Zscaler Private Access (ZPA).Before adding this option, you must generate a device token in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal and complete the full configuration in Using Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. |
| userName | The username of the user.You can also use an MDM macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation. | A maximum of 255 alphanumeric and special characters.For example, if the username is j.doe@zscaler.com, enter `j.doe` | If you use this option, the userDomain option must not be empty.For Microsoft Intune only: To use the same username used for enrolling in Intune, you can use the {{partialupn}} token. To view a complete list of available Intune tokens, refer to the Microsoft documentation. |
| enableFips | Indicates whether Zscaler Client Connector uses FIPS-compliant libraries for communication with Zscaler infrastructure. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | Enable this option only if you require FIPS-level security within your organization. |
| Ownership | If you use the Ownership Variable device posture type, add the key Ownership. You can enter up to 32 alphanumeric characters in the **Configuration value **field. To learn more, see Configuring Device Posture Profiles for ZPA. | Example: `acmecorp` |  |
| autoEnrollWithMDM | Use this parameter to configure auto-enrollment without user interaction when using Client Connector IdP. | Enter `0` to disable auto-enrollment.Enter `1` to always auto-enroll, even after log out.Enter `2` for one-time auto-enrollment. | When this parameter is set to either `1` or `2`, you must specify the parameters deviceToken, cloudName, and userDomain before enabling the autoEnrollWithMDM option. |
| customDNS | By default, Zscaler Client Connector uses the device's DNS server. You can change the value to another DNS server using this setting. Enter the DNS IP address. | Example: `4.2.2.2` |  |
| allowRunningOnRootedDevice | Restricts users from running Zscaler Client Connector on a rooted device. Enter `1` to allow users to run Zscaler Client Connector on a rooted device. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | Applies to Zscaler Client Connector version 3.7 and later for Android and Android on ChromeOS.This parameter was formerly allowZccOnRootedDevice. |
| allowRunningOnEmulator | Restricts users from running Zscaler Client Connector on an emulator. Enter `1` to allow users to run Zscaler Client Connector on an emulator. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | This parameter was formerly allowZccOnEmulator. |
| externalDeviceId | The identifier that associates devices in a mobile device management (MDM) solution with devices in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal. You can use an MDM macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation. | `0` = Disable (default)Enter a custom value to identify the device (e.g., `123456677754`). | Applies to Zscaler Client Connector version 3.7 and later for Android and Android on ChromeOS. |
