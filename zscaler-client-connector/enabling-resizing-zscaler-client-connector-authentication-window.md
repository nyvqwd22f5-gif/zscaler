You can configure Zscaler Client Connector to automatically resize when users are authenticating. This feature helps ensure users can see all the available options if you have configured a number of multi-factor authentication options. If you enable this feature, the app resizes the page as necessary to display all the options and then returns to its original dimensions after authentication.
This feature is available only for Zscaler Client Connector version 4.6 and later for Windows.
To enable resizing of the authentication window:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- In the left-side navigation, select **Platform Settings**.
- Select a platform tab.
-
Enable** Zscaler Client Connector Window Resizing**.
