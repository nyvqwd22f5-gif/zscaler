The integration of Zscaler Client Connector with Zscaler Deception enhances the ability of Zscaler Client Connector to manage the Deception process on endpoints. In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, you can selectively enable Deception for groups of users or devices.
While the Zscaler Client Connector Portal receives automatic configuration updates from Deception, you can click **Sync **to manually update Deception configurations. You can also require a password to disable Deception. To learn more, see [Configuring Zscaler Client Connector Profiles.](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-zscaler-client-connector-profiles)
