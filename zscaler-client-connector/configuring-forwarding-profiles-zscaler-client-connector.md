[Watch a video about forwarding profiles.](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/45hhpbxghv)
The [forwarding profile](/zscaler-client-connector/about-forwarding-profiles) tells Zscaler Client Connector how to treat traffic from your users' systems in different network environments for the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) services.
To configure a forwarding profile:
- Go to **Administration** > **Forwarding Profile**.
- Click **Add Forwarding Profile**.
The **Add Forwarding Profile** window appears.
- In the **Add Forwarding Profile** window:
- [Profile Definition](#profile-definition)
- [Trusted Network Criteria](#trusted-network-criteria)
- [Trusted Network Evaluation](#trusted-network-evaluation)
- [Windows Driver Selection](#windows-driver-selection)
- [Forwarding Profile Action for ZIA](#forwarding-profile-action-zia)
- [Forwarding Profile Action for ZPA](#forwarding-profile-action-zpa)
- Click **Save**.
[]In the **Profile Name** field, enter a unique alphanumeric name for the forwarding profile.
[]Define the network information and conditions that your network must meet for Zscaler Client Connector to verify that it's one of your trusted networks.
To configure the Trusted Network Criteria:
-
**Add Condition**: Select one of the following conditions, then click **Add Condition**.
Zscaler recommends using static properties, such as **DNS Server** and **DNS Search Domains**, for Trusted Network Criteria. In contrast, **Hostname and IP** resolution is a dynamic property because Zscaler Client Connector must resolve a hostname to see if it resolves to the IP address specified in the Trusted Network Criteria. There is a chance that a resolution might fail because of network transition processes. If a resolution fails, the app could incorrectly determine the network is an untrusted one, in which case it applies the incorrect forwarding profile action.
- **DNS Server**: The DNS servers where your corporate network sends DNS requests. Enter the DNS servers, separated by commas. IPv6 addresses are supported if you’re using Zscaler Client Connector version 3.4 and later for Windows. The app verifies at least one DNS server.
- **DNS Search Domains**: The search domains configured as the primary domains for the network adapter used for connecting to Zscaler. Enter the search domains, separated by commas. The app only verifies the primary domains assigned to the active network adapter.
- **Hostname and IP**: The hostname and the IP addresses where the hostname resolves when users are on the corporate network. For **Hostname**, enter the hostname. For **Resolved IPs for Hostname**, enter the IP addresses that the hostname resolves to, separated by commas. IPv6 addresses are supported if you’re using Zscaler Client Connector version 3.4 and later for Windows. The app verifies at least one IP address.
- **Network Range**: The network range for subnets and private IPs. Enter the valid network ranges, separated by commas.
- **Default Gateway**: Enter the IP address of the default gateway to the internet.
- **DHCP Server**: Enter the valid DHCP server, separated by commas.
- **Egress IP**: Enter the egress IP address of the network. This option allows you to differentiate a location that matches the trusted network criteria of other locations. Applies only to Zscaler Client Connector version 4.6 and later for Windows.
-
**Predefined Trusted Networks**: This option is only applicable if you have Zscaler Client Connector version 2.1 and later for Windows. Using this option allows you to select multiple trusted networks. To select networks from the drop-down menu, you must first define the Trusted Network Criteria for each network on the **Trusted Networks** page. To learn more, see [About Trusted Networks](/zscaler-client-connector/about-trusted-networks).
You cannot configure Trusted Network Criteria for a network (i.e., **DNS Server**, **DNS Search Domains**, or **Hostname and IP**) and use the **Predefined Trusted Networks** option at the same time.
Repeat this step to specify more than one condition.
- **Condition Match**: This field appears after you configure a condition.
- If specifying only one condition for the criteria, skip this step.
- If specifying multiple conditions for the criteria, select one of the following options:
- **Any**: Select if you want the app to validate only one of the conditions to determine if the network is trusted.
- **All**: Select if you want the app to validate all of the conditions to determine if the network is trusted.
[]Select how Zscaler Client Connector evaluates trusted network criteria.
- Select **Evaluate Trusted NW against All Default Route Adapters** to have Zscaler Client Connector evaluate trusted network criteria against all adapters with a default route. If more than one match is found, Zscaler Client Connector uses the adapter with the lowest metric.
- Select** Enable Split VPN-Trusted Network** to have Zscaler Client Connector detect if the device is running a split-tunnel VPN in addition to the currently supported full-tunnel VPN-trusted network detection.
- Select **Skip** **Trusted Criteria match for VPN Adapters **to have Zscaler Client Connector not require trusted network criteria to match VPN adapters. The adapter's presence triggers network detection.
[]Select the **Tunnel Driver Type** to use when handling traffic for Windows devices when in [**Tunnel** mode](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-forwarding-profiles-zscaler-app#tunnel):
- **Route-Based**: Zscaler Client Connector creates a virtual network adapter. The app uses OS routing to forward traffic via this interface to the Zscaler service.
-
**Packet Filter-Based**: Zscaler Client Connector uses Windows filtering to capture and forward traffic to the Zscaler service. This option allows for more granular control over traffic, reduces interoperability issues for applications that manage network adapters on the system, and allows VPN clients to better interoperate with the app. You must use this driver if you [enable packet capture](/zscaler-client-connector/enabling-packet-capture-zscaler-client-connector). This is the default value.
Zscaler Client Connector version 4.8 and later for Windows does not use the route-based driver. If a Windows device has Zscaler Client Connector version 4.8 or later installed, the app always uses the packet filter-based driver, regardless of this setting.
[]Define how Zscaler Client Connector treats traffic from your users' systems for the ZIA service for On-Trusted Network, VPN-Trusted Network, Off-Trusted Network, or Split VPN-Trusted Network types. To learn more, see [About Forwarding Profiles](/zscaler-client-connector/about-forwarding-profiles).
To specify how the app treats traffic from your users' systems, select one of the following forwarding profile actions for each network type:
- [Tunnel](#tunnel)
- [Tunnel with Local Proxy](#tunnel-with-local-proxy)
- [Enforce Proxy](#enforce-proxy)
- [None](#none)
If you want On-Trusted Network behavior to apply to VPN-Trusted Network or Off-Trusted Network, select **Same as "On-Trusted Network" **for either environment.
Zscaler recommends using **Tunnel **(**Packet Filter-Based**) as your forwarding profile action for Windows and using **Tunnel with Local Proxy** for macOS. With these modes, users don’t encounter interoperability issues if they have VPN clients running alongside Zscaler Client Connector. If you experience issues with **Tunnel** (**Packet Filter-Based**), Zscaler recommends that you use **Tunnel with Local Proxy** instead. To learn more, see [Best Practices for Zscaler Client Connector and VPN Client Interoperability](/zscaler-client-connector/best-practices-zscaler-client-connector-and-vpn-client-interoperability).
[]In **Tunnel** mode, the app tunnels traffic at the network layer. It captures user traffic by setting IP routes on user devices. The app forwards all port 80/443 traffic to the Zscaler service through a routing mode tunnel called the Zscaler Tunnel (Z-Tunnel).
-
(Optional) For **Tunnel Version Selection**, you can select which version of Z-Tunnel to use. To see this field, you must select [Packet Filter Based for the driver method](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-forwarding-profiles-zscaler-app#windows-driver-selection).
To use Z-Tunnel 2.0, you must complete all configuration steps. To learn more, see [Z-Tunnel 2.0](/zscaler-client-connector/about-z-tunnel-1.0-z-tunnel-2.0#z-tunnel-2).
If you select **Z-Tunnel 2.0**, the **Advanced Z-Tunnel Configuration** menu appears.
[See the instructions for Advanced Z-Tunnel Configuration.](#advanced-z-tunnel-config)
- For **Block Unreachable Domains Traffic**,** **this option drops or bypasses domains that are not reachable from the ZIA Public Service Edge.
- For **Drop IPv6 in Dual Stack Network**:
- Enable this option to have Zscaler Client Connector intercept and drop IPv6 packets coming from a dual stack network (IPv4 and IPv6 run simultaneously alongside each other). For Windows platforms, this setting is supported only in LWF mode.
- Disable this option when using IPv6. When this option is enabled, it takes precedence over all IPv6 settings.
- For **Drop IPv6 in IPv6 Only Network**:
- Enable this option to have Zscaler Client Connector intercept and drop IPv6 packets coming from an IPv6-only network. This setting prevents IPv6-only traffic from bypassing Zscaler Client Connector if IPv6 is not enabled or if IPv6 inclusions are not configured.
- Disable this option when using IPv6. When this option is enabled, it takes precedence over all IPv6 settings.
- **Dynamic ZIA Service Edge Assignment**: Enable this option to configure settings for probe interval, probe sample size, and threshold rank. The default setting is disabled.
- **Probe Interval (In Seconds)**: The time interval in which an IP address connects with a server. Choose a time between 30 to 600 seconds. The default is 60 seconds.
- **Probe Sample Size**: The number of retries required to establish a connection before a failover. The default is 5 times.
- **Threshold Rank**: Ranks the change in latency of the primary and secondary ZIA Public Service Edges, Private Service Edges, or Virtual Service Edges. Select a rank from 1 to 5 from the drop-down menu. If the value exceeds the threshold limit, the switch is made from the primary to the secondary Service Edge, or vice versa. Rank 1 is a minimum change, which is the most aggressive for switching from the primary to the secondary Service Edge.
-
In the **Configure System Proxy Settings** drop-down menu, define the proxy settings for your users’ systems.
For **Proxy Action Type**:
-
To define specific system proxy settings for user devices, select one of the following options:
- **Enforce**: If you select this option, Zscaler Client Connector enforces your proxy settings by monitoring system proxy changes and reapplying settings, which ensures that users cannot tamper with their proxy settings.
- **Apply on Trusted Network Type Change**: If you select this option, Zscaler Client Connector only applies your proxy settings when the network type changes. For example, the network shifts from a trusted network to an untrusted one. Zscaler Client Connector only updates system proxy settings on network type changes, but won’t monitor for proxy changes afterward.
- **Apply on Any Network Change**: If you select this option, Zscaler Client Connector only applies your proxy settings if there is any network change, but does not monitor for proxy changes afterward.
- **Never**: If you select this option, Zscaler Client Connector never alters your proxy settings.
Configure the following system proxy settings:
- **Automatically Detect Settings**: Select this option if you want the users’ devices to use proxy discovery on the network.
- **PAC URL Location**: Select this option if you want to use a PAC file to specify automatic proxy settings on users’ devices. Zscaler Client Connector enforces your chosen proxy settings based on the PAC file retrieved from the selected location:
- **PAC URL**: If you select this option, enter a valid PAC URL in the **Custom PAC URL** field. The maximum number of characters is 512. If [Enforce Secure PAC URLs](/zscaler-client-connector/enforcing-secure-pac-urls) is enabled, you must enter a URL with the https:// prefix (not http://).
- **Registry Key**: If you select this option, enter the following:
- **Registry Path**: The registry path for Zscaler Client Connector to locate the PAC URL from the device. The maximum number of characters is 61,440.
- **Registry Name**: The registry name for Zscaler Client Connector to locate the PAC URL from the device. The maximum number of characters is 2,048.
- **Use Proxy Server for Your LAN**: Select this option if you want to use a specific proxy server and port. For **IP Address or Domain**, enter an FQDN, IP address, or a plain hostname with the http:// or https:// prefix. For **Port**, enter any port ranging from 1 to** **65534. Select **Bypass Proxy Server for Local Addresses** if you want to bypass local resources.
- **Execute GPO Update**: Select this option if you want to execute the GPO update command on Windows devices when Zscaler Client Connector detects a network change.
- To ensure that Zscaler Client Connector never updates any system proxy settings for user devices, select **Never**.
[]
Zscaler Client Connector version 4.3 and later for iOS supports Z-Tunnel 2.0 over TLS. DTLS is not supported on iOS devices.
- **Primary Transport Selection**: Select the primary transport for Z-Tunnel 2.0. This setting determines how Zscaler Client Connector connects to the cloud. **DTLS** uses UDP over port 443 and **TLS** uses TCP over port 443.
- **DTLS Connection Timeout**: Enter any value from 5 to 60 seconds. This setting determines how long Zscaler Client Connector waits before falling back to another transport mechanism.
- **TLS Connection Timeout**: Enter any value from 5 to 60 seconds. This setting determines how long Zscaler Client Connector waits before falling back to another transport mechanism.
-
**MTU for Zscaler Adapter**: (Optional) This option is only applicable if you’re using Zscaler Client Connector version 2.1.2 or later. Select Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) value between 800 and 1400 for Z-Tunnel 2.0 inner IP packet. The default value is 0 (zero). The default value for a direct connection is 1400 and 1360/1300 for GRE/IPSec tunnels, respectively. Windows leverages maximum Maximum Segment Size (MSS) clipping. For IPv6, the acceptable range is 1300-1400.
For the Windows version of Zscaler Client Connector, Z-Tunnel 2.0 (in DTLS mode) changes the MSS for the TCP stream based on the configured MTU value because it uses the Windows filter driver instead of the Zscaler adapter.
- **Path MTU Discovery**: Select this option to have Zscaler Client Connector discover the optimal path MTU for Z-Tunnel 2.0. You can use this option even if you change the value for MTU for Zscaler Adapter.
- **Allow TLS Fallback**: (Optional) This option is only applicable if you’re using Zscaler Client Connector version 3.4 or later for Windows, Zscaler Client Connector version 3.9 or later for macOS, and Zscaler Client Connector version 4.3 and later for iOS. If DTLS is set as your primary transport selection, you can enable TLS as a fallback option. If Zscaler Client Connector is unable to connect using DTLS, it attempts to connect using TLS.
- **Enable DTLS Instability Detection and Fallback**: If DTLS is set as your primary transport selection and **Allow TLS Fallback** is enabled, you can enable this option to have Zscaler Client Connector monitor the stability of the DTLS connection and automatically switch to TLS if a data transfer rate restriction is detected (e.g., throttling due to a misconfigured network device or a network policy).
-
Applies only to Zscaler Client Connector version 4.8 and later for Windows. Contact Zscaler Support to enable this feature.
- **Z-Tunnel 2.0 Setup Failure Behavior**: (Optional) This option is only applicable if you’re using Zscaler Client Connector version 3.4 or later. In cases where you might need Zscaler Client Connector to switch from Z-Tunnel 2.0 to Z-Tunnel 1.0, you can define the behavior for Zscaler Client Connector to follow.
- **Fall back to Z-Tunnel 1.0 and bypass non-web traffic**: Zscaler Client Connector tunnels web traffic via Z-Tunnel 1.0 and bypasses everything else.
- **Fall back to Z-Tunnel 1.0 and block non-web traffic**: Zscaler Client Connector tunnels web traffic via Z-Tunnel 1.0 and blocks all traffic that cannot be tunneled, except the DNS.
- **Block all traffic**: Zscaler Client Connector blocks all traffic except DNS and control-channel communications to the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) for policy, PAC file, and software updates.
-
**Send All DNS During Fail-Close to Trusted-DNS Server**: (Optional) Select this option to send DNS traffic to a specific DNS server during a Z-Tunnel 2.0 failure. If enabled, you can enter IP addresses for an IPv4 DNS server and an IPv6 DNS server. If you select this option but don’t enter a server, Zscaler Client Connector uses the DNS server in the original request if it’s configured on the device or the first DNS server on the system.
Applies only to Zscaler Client Connector version 4.7 for Windows and is available only if **Fall back to Z-Tunnel 1.0 and bypass non-web traffic** or **Block all traffic** is selected. Contact Zscaler Support to enable this feature.
- **IPv4 Trusted DNS Server During Fail-Close**: Enter an IPv4 IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`). Zscaler Client Connector uses this server for DNS requests to an IPv4 destination.
- **IPv6 Trusted DNS Server During Fail-Close**: Enter an IPv6 IP address (e.g., `[2001:0000::]`). Zscaler Client Connector uses this server for DNS requests to an IPv6 destination.
-
**Drop IPv6 Include Traffic When not supported**:** **Enable this option to drop IPv6 traffic that matches the destination inclusion if IPv6 is not provisioned for the company or the ZIA Public Service Edge.
Zscaler Client Connector version 4.1 and later for Windows supports IPv6 tunneling in dual stack and IPv6-only networks in both Z-Tunnel 1.0 and Z-Tunnel 2.0. While Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) can process both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, because the infrastructure supports only IPv4 traffic, IPv6-only network addresses are converted to IPv4.
- **Redirect Web Traffic to Zscaler Client Connector Listening Proxy**: Enable this option to redirect all 80/443 traffic to the Zscaler Client Connector listening proxy, with the remaining traffic passing through Z-Tunnel 2.0. Enabling this option allows bypasses in the app profile PAC to be applied to web traffic without a forwarding profile PAC.
-
**Use Z-Tunnel 2.0 for Proxied Web Traffic**: Enable this option to have Zscaler Client Connector use the Z-Tunnel 2.0 protocol to tunnel web traffic received on the Zscaler Client Connector listening proxy. If this option is disabled and **Redirect Web Traffic to Zscaler Client Connector Listening Proxy** is enabled, Zscaler Client Connector uses Z-Tunnel 1.0 for web traffic and Z-Tunnel 2.0 for the remaining traffic.
Zscaler recommends enabling both **Redirect Web Traffic to Zscaler Client Connector Listening Proxy** and **Use Z-Tunnel 2.0 for Proxied Web Traffic**. For more information, see [Best Practices for Adding Bypasses for Z-Tunnel 2.0](/zscaler-client-connector/best-practices-adding-bypasses-z-tunnel-2.0).
[]In **Tunnel with Local Proxy** mode, Zscaler Client Connector sets proxy settings on user devices so that all proxy-aware traffic is tunneled to Zscaler. The app does this by automatically installing a PAC file on the system to force all traffic to go to the local host.
When using Zscaler Client Connector for Linux in openSUSE KDE or Arch Linux KDE environments, use Firefox version 109 or earlier. Firefox version 110 can send traffic directly.
If you select Z-Tunnel 1.0, you have the option to select **Block Unreachable Domains Traffic**. This drops or bypasses domains that are not reachable from the ZIA Public Service Edge.
In the **Configure System Proxy Settings** drop-down menu, define the proxy settings for your users’ systems.
For **Proxy Action Type**:
The** Enforce** option is selected by default and cannot be changed. This option allows Zscaler Client Connector to enforce your proxy settings by monitoring for network changes and reapplying settings. Zscaler Client Connector also ensures that users cannot tamper with their proxy settings.
