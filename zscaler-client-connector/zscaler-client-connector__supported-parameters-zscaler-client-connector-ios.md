| Parameter | Description | Value | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- |
| userDomain | Your organization's domain name. If your instance has multiple domains associated with it, enter the primary domain for your instance.The primary domain is only valid if you are using a single identity provider (IdP) with multiple domains. The primary domain won’t work if you have multiple domains across multiple IdPs. | Example: `safemarch.com`Specify the exact domain that is present in the SAML NameID field. For example, if your user’s NameID is john.doe@corp.company.com, then enter `corp.company.com`. | This install option allows users to skip the app enrollment page. If SSO is enabled for your organization, users are taken directly to your organization's SSO login page. |
| cloudname | The name of the cloud on which your organization is provisioned.If your organization is provisioned on more than one cloud, your users are asked to select the cloud where their traffic is sent during the enrollment process. With this install option, you can specify the cloud where the app sends user traffic, so your users don't have to make the selection during enrollment. | If your cloud name is zscalertwo.net, enter `zscalertwo`. To learn more, see What Is My Cloud Name for ZIA? | Do not use this option if your organization is provisioned on one cloud. The app automatically sends traffic to the proper cloud and your users don't need to make a selection during enrollment.This option is required if you use the strictEnforcement option. |
| strictEnforcement | Allows you to require users to enroll with the app before accessing the internet and blocks traffic in the following situations:The user has not yet logged in after a new installation.A user logs in and logs out.An administrator removes a device from the Zscaler Client Connector Portal. | `1` = Enable`0` = Disable (default) | If you enable Strict Enforcement, you must use the policyToken configuration key. Excluded URLs must also be defined in a device configuration policy or excludeList in an app configuration policy. |
| excludeList | Allows you to exclude domains and IP addresses that should never be tunneled by Zscaler Client Connector with or without strictEnforcement. If you are using strictEnforcement, enter your MDM server or anything else the user should have access to before enrollment. | Enter a value, for example, `apple.com`, `airwatch.com`. | If you use the Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) service, you must enter `authsp.prod.zpath.net`. For a list of additional requirements, refer to your MDM's requirements for this parameter. For a list of Apple's recommendations for destinations that should be excluded, refer to the Apple documentation. |
| newBindFlow | Enables multithreaded implementation of Zscaler Client Connector microservices binding with Zscaler Client Connector virtual interface. | `1` = Enable (default)`0` = Disable | Applicable to per-app VPN deployments only. |
| deviceToken | The appropriate device token from the Zscaler Client Connector Portal if you want to use the Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. The Zscaler service silently provisions and authenticates users even if you don't have an authentication mechanism in place. | Example: `123456677754` | This option applies only to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). It is not supported by ZPA unless you also use ZIdentity.Before adding this option, you must generate a device token in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal and complete the full configuration in Using Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. |
| policyToken | Allows you to specify which app profile policy you want to enforce for the app before the user enrolls. All relevant settings associated with the policy apply, including the bypass of the IdP login page.After the user enrolls, this policy is replaced with an app profile policy that matches the user based on group affiliation. | Example: 393837313A313A64666131313635652D376536372D343032312D393232362D363264393931666135762960 | Applies only, and is required if you use the strictEnforcement option.In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, you must configure the app profile policy that you want to enforce and ensure that the custom PAC file associated with that policy includes a bypass for your IdP login page. This allows the user to access the IdP page to log in as necessary before enrolling with the app. |
| username | The username of the user.You can also use an MDM macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation for available macros. | A maximum of 255 alphanumeric and special characters.For example, if the username is j.doe@zscaler.com, enter `j.doe` | If you use this option, the userDomain option must not be empty. |
| authByTunnel | The auto-enrollment settings for users when Zscaler Client Connector Portal is used as an IdP for authentication. | `1`= Users will always auto-enroll even if they are logged out manually or forcefully removed from the portal`2`= One-time auto-enrollment`0`= Disable auto-enrollment | This option applies only to ZIA. If ZPA is enabled, users would login manually with their user credentials. |
| ownership | If you use the Ownership Variable device posture type, add the key `ownership`. You can enter up to 32 alphanumeric characters in the **Configuration value **field. To learn more, see Configuring Device Posture Profiles for ZPA. | Example: `acmecorp` |  |
| SkipInterfaceInstallation | When enabled, only shows VPN icon in iOS when user is logged into Zscaler Client Connector. | `1` = Enable`0` = Disable (default) | Requires Tunnel SDK version 3.7 and later. |
| DropNonRoutingTraffic | Drops traffic without routes. | `1` = Enable`0` = Disable (default) |  |
| PAVConnectionSynced | Delays Per-app VPN connection until Zscaler Client Connector is connected. | `1` = Enable`0` = Disable (default) | Applicable to per-app VPN deployments only. |
| externalDeviceId | The identifier that associates devices in an MDM solution with devices in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal.You can use an MDM macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation for available macros. | `0` = Disable (default)Enter a custom value to identify the device (e.g., `123456677754`). |  |
| enableFips | Indicates whether Zscaler Client Connector uses FIPS-compliant libraries for communication with the Zscaler infrastructure. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | Enable this option only if you require FIPS-level security within your organization. |
| MatchDomainsNoSearch | When enabled, ZPA match domains are not appended as search domains on the device. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) |  |
