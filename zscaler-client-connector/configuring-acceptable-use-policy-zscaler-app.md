This field only appears if you select Custom as the AUP frequency. Enter any value from 1 to 180 days.
- **Configure AUP Message**: Enter or copy and paste your organization's AUP into the field. You can enter static HTML tags as well as images, as long as the image files are accessible from the internet.
- **Preview AUP Message**: Click to view the AUP as your users will see it.
