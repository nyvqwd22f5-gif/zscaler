You can display a custom banner on the top of the Zscaler Client Connector app to provide information about your organization’s IT support resources (e.g., local help desk contact information or a link to submit an internal help desk ticket).
This feature is available only for Zscaler Client Connector version 4.6 and later for Windows.
To configure a banner:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- In the left-side navigation, go to **Client Connector Notifications**.
-
On the** Custom Banner Notification** tab:
- **Configure Banner Message**: Enter the support information. You can enter plain text, static HTML tags, images (if the image files are accessible from the internet), and URLs. The maximum number of alphanumeric characters is 200.
- **Preview Banner Message**: Click to view the notification banner as your users will see it.
