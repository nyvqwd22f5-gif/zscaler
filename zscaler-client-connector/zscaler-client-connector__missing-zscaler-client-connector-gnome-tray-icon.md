Using the Zscaler Client Connector GNOME tray icon in Linux distributions requires enabling the third-party GNOME extension, `AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support`.
When enabling this extension with openSUSE 15.3 and 15.4 Leap with GNOME Desktop, there is a known issue where the tray icon does not display on the screen.
