If you are using Zscaler Client Connector for Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), be aware of the new limitation that Windows 10 introduced in version 2004 and later. This new version of Windows only supports up to 50 DNS suffixes per system. So, when you configure DNS search domains in the ZPA Admin Portal, you must ensure that no system will exceed 50 DNS suffixes. To learn more, see [Adding DNS Search Domains](/zpa/about-applications/dnsDomains).
