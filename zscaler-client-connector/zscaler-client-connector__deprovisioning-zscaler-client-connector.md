After an admin [soft removes](/zscaler-client-connector/soft-removing-device-zscaler-client-connector-portal) your device from the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, it can take an hour for the device to be completely removed. However, you can immediately remove the device from Zscaler Client Connector as an end user. When you remove a device, Zscaler Client Connector logs you out but does not uninstall the app from the device. To uninstall the app, see [Uninstalling Zscaler Client Connector](/zscaler-client-connector/uninstalling-zscaler-client-connector).
To remove a device from Zscaler Client Connector as an end user:
- In Zscaler Client Connector, click **More**.
- Click **Update Policy**.
