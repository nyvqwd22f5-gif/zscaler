Uploading your organization's custom SSL certificate is an optional step you can complete when [configuring SSL inspection for Zscaler Client Connector](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-ssl-inspection-zscaler-app).
When you upload your organization’s custom SSL certificate in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, and [turn on the install Zscaler SSL Certificate option](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-ssl-inspection-zscaler-app), the custom certificate is automatically installed on users’ devices.
The **Install Zscaler SSL Certificate** feature is not supported on devices running macOS Big Sur (11) and later.
To upload the custom certificate:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- From the menu on the left, go to** Client Connector Support**.
- Click the **Advanced Configuration** tab.
- Under **Custom Certificate**, click **Upload**.
