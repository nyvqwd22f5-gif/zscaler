| Parameter | Description | Value | Notes |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- |
| MSI: `USERDOMAIN`EXE: `userDomain` | Your organization's domain name. If your instance has multiple domains associated with it, enter the primary domain for your instance.The primary domain is only valid if you are using a single IdP with multiple domains. The primary domain won’t work if you have multiple domains across multiple IdPs. | Example: `safemarch.com`Specify the exact domain that is present in the SAML NameID field. For example, if your user’s NameID is john.doe@corp.company.com, then enter `corp.company.com`. | This install option allows users to skip the app enrollment page. If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your organization, users are taken directly to your organization's SSO login page.If you've integrated SSO with the app (i.e., using a mechanism like Integrated Windows Authentication [IWA]), users can also skip the SSO login page and are automatically enrolled with Zscaler service and logged in.To use this install option when deploying Zscaler Client Connector with non-persistent Citrix VDIs, you must use IWA.An alternative to using this install option is to change the name of the installer file. To learn more, see Allow Users to Log into Zscaler Client Connector Without Entering Domains. |
| MSI: `CLOUDNAME`EXE: `cloudName` | The name of the cloud on which your organization is provisioned. To learn more, see What Is My Cloud Name for ZIA?If your organization is provisioned on more than one cloud, your users are asked to select the cloud where their traffic is sent during the enrollment process. With this install option, you can specify the cloud where the app sends user traffic, so your users don't have to make the selection during enrollment. | If your cloud name is zscalertwo.net, enter `zscalertwo` or `zscalertwo.net` | Do not use this option if your organization is provisioned on one cloud. The app automatically sends traffic to the proper cloud and your users don't need to make a selection during enrollment.This option is required if you use the `STRICTENFORCEMENT` or `strictEnforcement` option. |
| MSI: `DEVICETOKEN`EXE: `deviceToken` | The appropriate device token from the Zscaler Client Connector Portal if you want to use the Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. The Zscaler service silently provisions and authenticates users even if you don't have an authentication mechanism in place. | Example: `123456677754` | This option applies only to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). It is not supported by Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) unless you also use ZIdentity.Before adding this option, you must generate a device token in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal and complete the full configuration in Using Zscaler Client Connector Portal as an IdP. |
| MSI: `UNAME`EXE: `userName` | The username of the user.You can also use a Mobile Device Management (MDM) macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation. | A maximum of 255 alphanumeric and special characters.For example, if the username is j.doe@zscaler.com, enter `j.doe` | If you use this option, the `USERDOMAIN` or `userDomain` option must not be empty. |
| MSI: `ENABLEFIPS`EXE: `enableFips` | Indicates whether Zscaler Client Connector uses FIPS-compliant libraries for communication with the Zscaler infrastructure. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | Enable this option only if you require FIPS-level security within your organization. |
| MSI: `EXTERNALDEVICEID`EXE: `externalDeviceId` | The identifier that associates devices in an MDM solution with devices in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal.You can use an MDM macro to auto-populate this value. Refer to your MDM's documentation. | `0` = Disable (default)Enter a custom value to identify the device (e.g., `123456677754`). | Not supported on Zscaler Client Connector version 4.0 and ealier for Windows. |
| MSI: `HIDEAPPUIONLAUNCH`EXE: `hideAppUIOnLaunch` | Forces the app window to stay hidden before users enroll. Users can always open the window by clicking the app icon in the system tray. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) | If Zscaler Client Connector is installed with the `cloudName` and `userDomain` options, Zscaler Client Connector attempts to automatically perform SSO. |
| MSI: `POLICYTOKEN`EXE: `policyToken` | Allows you to specify which app profile policy you want to enforce for the app before the user enrolls. All relevant settings associated with the policy apply, including the bypass of the IdP login page.After the user enrolls, this policy is replaced with an app profile policy that matches the user based on group affiliation. | Example: `123456677754` | Applies only, and is required, in the following situations:You use the `STRICTENFORCEMENT` or `strictEnforcement` option.You configure the machine tunnel and want the users to access ZPA applications before logging in to the device.In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, you must configure the app profile policy that you want to enforce and ensure that the custom PAC file associated with that policy includes a bypass for your IdP login page. This allows the user to access the IdP page to log in as necessary before enrolling with the app. |
| MSI: `REINSTALLDRIVER`EXE: `reinstallDriver` | Forces a reinstallation of the driver, even if you already have a driver installed. Use this option if you're having issues with your current driver. | `1` = Enable`0`= Disable (default) |  |
