You can register a device in the Zscaler Client Connector Portal with the username entered for ZPA authentication instead of the username that is used for enrollment in the app.

- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- From the menu on the left, go to** Client Connector Support**.
- On the **App Supportability** tab, select the **Register device with ZPA IdP Username** switch.
