| Error Code | Error Message | Error Description | Resolution |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 2008 | Authentication failed due to an invalid redirection URL. Please try again. | This error occurs when a user delays ZPA authentication. | Authenticate again. If the error persists, contact Zscaler Support. |
| 42000 | Inconsistency in user credentials is detected. Log out of the client and retry. | When the user attempts to reauthenticate to ZPA, this error occurs if:The user enters a different username instead of the one provided during initial enrollment.The IdP SAML response has a different NameID instead of the one sent during initial enrollment. | Verify that the user has entered the username provided during initial enrollment, and have the user retry authentication.If the error persists, verify that the IdP SAML response has the NameID that ZPA received during initial enrollment.You can also have the user log out from Zscaler Client Connector and attempt to re-enroll into ZPA. |
| 42001 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs when a user attempts to log in to Zscaler Client Connector without a domain name. In this case, ZPA cannot identify the user's organization and as a result cannot proceed further. This is not applicable if you have specifically configured the App installer so that the domain name is not required in the username field. | Verify that the user has entered a valid domain as part of the username (for example, joe@safemarch.com). This is not applicable if you have specifically configured the App installer so that the domain name is not required in the username field (in this case, the user would only enter joe). |
| 42002 | Zscaler Private Access is not configured for your company. | This error occurs when ZPA is not configured correctly and is unable to identify the IdP that must be used for enrolling the user. | Verify that an IdP is configured for ZPA and that the IdP can communicate with ZPA. Prior to enrolling users with Zscaler Client Connector, verify that your IdP Configuration is correctly set up for SSO. |
| 42004 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs if Zscaler Client Connector is not sending the expected information to ZPA during the user's enrollment process. | Verify that single sign-on (SSO) for ZPA has been configured correctly. Prior to enrolling users with Zscaler Client Connector, verify that your IdP Configuration is correctly set up for SSO. |
| 42005 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs if ZPA cannot correctly interpret the information sent by Zscaler Client Connector during the user's enrollment process. | Verify that SSO for ZPA has been configured correctly. Prior to enrolling users with Zscaler Client Connector, verify that your IdP Configuration is correctly set up for SSO. |
| 42006 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs when the SAML response validation fails. The failure could be due to issues like the system clock being out of sync, an expired IdP certificate, a failure in the SAML response signature validation, or issues around IdP lookup by IdP entity ID. | Verify that SSO for ZPA has been configured correctly. Prior to enrolling users with Zscaler Client Connector, verify that your IdP Configuration is correctly set up for SSO. |
| 42007 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs when the certificate signing request in ZPA fails during the user enrollment process. | Verify that the signing certificate chosen for enrolling the user device to ZPA is valid. ZPA provides a default signing certificate that can be used when enrolling user devices to ZPA. Check the ZPA Admin Portal to ensure this certificate is still available, or if a new, valid certificate has been added in its place. If the error persists, contact Zscaler Support. |
| 42010 | Internal Error: Contact Administrator | This error occurs if ZPA does not receive the expected information during the user enrollment process. | This is an internal error. Contact Zscaler Support. |
| 42013 | The message is not of the SAML response object type. | This error occurs if the IdP SAML response doesn’t match the expected SAML response object type. | Update the IdP configuration to send the expected object type in the SAML response. |
| 42014 | The SAML response status is unsuccessful. | This error occurs if the status in the SAML response is unsuccessful. | Review the user’s information in the IdP and have the user retry logging in. |
| 42015 | Failed to validate the SAML response signature. | This error occurs if:This error occurs if the IdP certificates aren't configured correctly, and the ZPA authentication service needs to validate the SAML response signature.The public certificate used by ZPA to validate the SAML response from the IdP has expired. | Verify that the IdP certificates are configured correctly in ZPA.Check the expiration date of the IdP certificate, and upload a valid certificate if the current certificate has expired. |
| 42016 | The response issue time is either too old or with date in the future.**IdP Issue Time**: [Timestamp]s**Accepted Range**: [Timestamp]s to [Timestamp]s | This error occurs if the IdP and the ZPA authentication service clocks have a large skew. The maximum accepted skew time is 120 seconds. | Ensure the value for the response issue time is in the accepted range. |
| 42017 | The IdP originated SSO is not supported. | This error occurs if the IdP sends ZPA a SAML response without the ZPA authentication service initiating it. | Only the service provider (SP) initiated SSO is supported with ZPA. |
| 42018 | Failed to look up the SAML request corresponding to the SAML response received. | This error occurs if the ZPA authentication service failed to look up the SAML request corresponding to the SAML response from its database. | Contact Zscaler Support. |
| 42019 | The intended destination doesn't match any of the configured endpoints. | This error occurs if the assertion consumer endpoint of the ZPA authentication service isn't properly configured in the IdP. | Review the SP configuration in your IdP. |
| 42020 | Failed to validate the issuer in the SAML response. | This error occurs if the IdP entity ID isn't properly configured in the ZPA Admin Portal. The entity ID is case sensitive. | In the ZPA Admin Portal, review the entity ID of the IdP configuration. |
| 42021 | Possible error messages:The assertion is too old to be used.The assertion failed the validation because of the set notBefore condition.The assertion failed the validation because of the set notOnOrAfter condition. | This error occurs if the ZPA authentication service failed to validate the assertions in the SAML response. The assertion validation may fail due to timing issues, unsupported assertion conditions (e.g., OneTimeUse condition), etc. | Ensure the value for the response issue time is in the valid range. |
| 42022 | Missing NameID in the SAML response. | This error occurs if the SAML response doesn't have NameID in it. | In the IdP configuration, ensure NameID is part of the subject in the SAML response message. |
