From the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, you can view and copy the one-time password for each enrolled device. You can use this password in place of the disable, logout, exit, and revert Zscaler Client Connector passwords defined in [Zscaler Client Connector app profiles](/zscaler-client-connector/configuring-zscaler-client-connector-app-profiles).
The one-time password consists of 10 random alphanumeric characters. The password remains in effect until it's used and can only be used once. After the password is used, a new password is auto-generated during the next policy update. This password is unique to the device and only the user of the device can use it.
To view and copy the one-time password:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Enrolled Devices**.
- Click the **View **icon (![View_icon_15.png](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/client-connector-draft-articles/about-one-time-passwords-enrolled-devices/View_icon_15.png)
) to view the device fingerprint for the enrolled device.
- In the **One Time Password** field, click the **Copy **icon (![Copy.png](/downloads/tech-pubs-drafts/client-connector-draft-articles/about-one-time-passwords-enrolled-devices/Copy.png)
) to copy the one-time password.
