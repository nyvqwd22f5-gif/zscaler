If you want to upgrade to macOS Big Sur, you must first upgrade Zscaler Client Connector to [version 2.2.4](/zscaler-client-connector/client-connector-app-release-summary-2020?applicable_category=macOS&applicable_version=2.2.4) or later.
Also, on macOS Big Sur devices, Apple requires password confirmation for the user's account before Zscaler Client Connector can install and trust the root certificate. As a workaround, certificates can be installed via MDM for trust.
