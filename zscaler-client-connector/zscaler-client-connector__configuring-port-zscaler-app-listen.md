By default, Zscaler Client Connector listens on port 9000 for ZIA and port 9010 for ZPA via a TCP protocol. Zscaler Client Connector automatically listens to the next port if another application is listening to the port. However, if Zscaler Client Connector starts before the other application and begins listening on port 9000 for ZIA or port 9010 for ZPA, the other application can fail.
In order to avoid port conflicts with other applications, you can configure the port for Zscaler Client Connector to listen on.
You must configure any local proxy PAC file to point to the configured port.
To configure the port:
- In the Zscaler Client Connector Portal, go to **Administration**.
- From the menu on the left, go to** Client Connector Support**.
- Click on the **Endpoint Integration** tab.
- In the **Zscaler Client Connector Listen Port **field, enter the number for any port ranging from 1024 to 65534.

- Click **Save**.
When a device enrolls and downloads the policy, the listening port is downloaded. Zscaler Client Connector listens to this port the next time Zscaler Client Connector, the Zscaler service, or the device itself restarts. Zscaler Client Connector does not switch ports while it is running.
