In Zscaler Client Connector versions 4.1.0.82 for Windows, Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams applications are not accessible when using Tunnel with Local Proxy while connected to the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) service because the option to Disable Loopback Restriction fails in some scenarios.
This issue was fixed in Zscaler Client Connector version 4.1.0.98 for Windows.
