You can download the list of all findings that are tracked in the discovered assets as part of your organization's external attack surface from the [Findings page](/easm/about-findings) as a CSV file. The data captured in the file directly replicates the table as it is displayed on the Findings page, reflecting any customization made through sorting, filtering, and selecting columns. This ensures that the downloaded file precisely mirrors the current view of the findings as seen on the page.
To download a list of findings in the CSV format:
- Go to **Insights **> **Findings**.
- Customize the list as required using the following options:
- Apply filters to display the findings that must be downloaded.
- Select the required columns from the **Column Chooser** to include the respective data of the findings in the downloaded file.
- Sort the list of finding records by a specific column using the **Sorting** icon in the column header.
-
Click the **Download **icon on the top-right corner of the page.
The findings are downloaded as a CSV file.
