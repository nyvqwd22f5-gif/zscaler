The assets discovered as part of your digital attack surface are automatically added to your inventory and appear on the Assets page. These assets are continuously monitored through periodic scans, and they are subsequently used as targets to identify other linked assets that can be attributed to your organization. This process involves scanning across the internet recursively to uncover connected assets. Your external attack surface is constantly monitored and any changes to the attack surface, including new assets discovered and changes in the inventoried assets and their risk associations, are promptly reflected on the Assets page.
The Assets page offers a highly customizable, tabulated list of assets, where you can click on each record to access detailed information and perform specific actions on a per-asset basis. The asset details consist of contextual information tailored to each asset type, helping you understand key aspects such as the technologies and services running on the asset, SSL/TLS certificates used, the asset's risk score and risk level, vulnerabilities and risks associated with the asset, and the asset's relationship to your organization through the discovery chain. The vulnerabilities and risks are evaluated based on a wide range of factors, including the technologies and services running on the asset, digital certificates used by the asset, domain registration, host names, HTTP headers used, other exposures, etc. The assets are mapped to their risk findings in a many-to-many relationship (i.e., one asset can have multiple risk findings and vice-versa). The discovered assets are categorized into one or more of the following types, with the details varying across asset types to ensure relevant and actionable insights for each category.
- Domain
- Host
- Web Page
- Certificate
- ASN
- IP Address
- IP Block
The asset details are presented in two different views, offering users the flexibility to drill down on the asset details as required. When you click on a row of the assets table, a right-side drawer referred to as the Asset Details drawer, opens, providing a quick overview of essential information. This drawer features a tabbed interface for the asset details and its associated findings. To further drill down on the asset information, from the Asset Details drawer, you can access a comprehensive, full-page view, referred to as the Asset Details page. This page offers more extensive details compared to the Asset Details drawer. To access the full-page view, click the View More Details button on the Asset Details tab of the Asset Details drawer.

The Asset Details page provides extensive information about the asset and also mirrors the tabbed interface for the asset details and findings, as seen in the Asset Details drawer. The Asset Details drawer serves as a streamlined, condensed version of the Asset Details page, allowing you to quickly switch between different assets to view their details from the list view with ease. On the other hand, the Asset Details page is designed for deeper analysis of a specific asset, offering full access to the complete data set available. This makes it particularly useful when a more thorough examination of the asset details is required. When you are in the Asset Details page, you can go back to the assets list view to access details of other assets.

The following sections provide a detailed overview of all the asset details that are available, following the presentation layout and the comprehensive information tracked in the Asset Details page. On the Asset Details page (Insights > [Asset record] > Asset Details > View More Details), the asset name is displayed at the top along with the asset's overview, details, and risks.
Some of the following documented fields under each section are exclusive to the Asset Details page and might not appear in the Asset Details drawer and vice-versa. Additionally, the content organization differs between the two views to optimize the user experience for each.
Asset Overview
This section provides the following high-level information about the asset:
- **Type**: The type of the asset categorized into Domain, Host, Web Page, Certificate, ASN, IP Address, or IP Block. Depending on the type, the asset details presented in the inventory differ.
- **Risk Level**: The risk level quantifies the amount of risk posed by an asset, and it is derived from the risk score calculated for the associated findings. The risk level ranges from Minimum to Critical, giving users an immediate sense of asset's criticality and providing guidance in prioritizing business-critical or concerning assets. For example, a critical or high risk level indicates that an asset poses significant risk without mitigation controls, whereas a low risk level might indicate an acceptable risk or commonly found issues. A medium risk level might indicate that the asset should be safeguarded but might have a lower priority compared to higher-risk assets. Available risk levels: Minimum, Low, Medium, High, and Critical.
- **ID**: A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) generated and assigned to the asset by EASM.
- **First Seen**: The timestamp when the asset was first discovered in a scan.
- **Last Seen**: The timestamp when the asset was last observed in a scan.
-
**Status**: Indicates the status of the asset's relationship with your organization and allows you to review and determine whether an asset must be included in the inventory. You can modify the status of the asset using the drop-down menu. The following three statuses are supported for assets, and assets can be transitioned from one status to any other status depending on the requirements:
[Available Statuses](#asset-statuses)

Asset Details
On the Details tab, you can access extensive information including the asset metadata, comprehensive information about the asset registry obtained from the Whois database, technologies and services observed to be running on the asset, and the digital certificates associated with it. This tab includes the following sections:
-
**General Information**: This section provides basic information about the asset, which varies across the different types of asset, as captured in the following table.
[Available Fields for Each Asset Type](#asset-info-based-on-type)
-
**Whois**: The Whois protocol is a query-and-response system used to retrieve registration and ownership data of internet resources. EASM uses this protocol to provide detailed information about the registry of an asset using Whois for different types of assets including domains, hosts, web pages, ASNs, IP addresses, and IP blocks.
[Available Fields](#whois-info)
-
**Discovery Chain**: This section presents the full path of asset discovery in a sequential link chain, originating from the seed asset and interconnected to a series of assets identified in the subsequent mapping, leading up to the discovery of the current asset. It enables asset source traceability and provides attestation of auto-attributed assets based on a seed, allowing you to self-validate your assets using the investigative trail provided. The discovery path is presented as a link chain, featuring the seed asset, intermediate nodes, and the current asset in a sequence, along with the services and attributes used to identify assets in each discovery hop as applicable.
[See Examples](#discovery-chain-examples)
The following actions are supported:
- Each asset node in the discovery chain is clickable and takes you to the corresponding asset page for further investigation.
- To view the asset link with more contextual text, you can turn off the toggle button on the top right of this section. This displays the asset links in a series of steps with additional information about each asset node.
- You can zoom in and out of the discovery chain when viewing it in the link chain view and move it around the canvas.
When an asset is discovered in more than one way, the discovery path with the highest confidence is shown.
- **Technologies**: This section provides a tabulated list of technologies used on the asset and their associated details, such as the version number, CVE ID for any associated vulnerabilities or exploits, and more. This data highlights risky technologies used on the asset, such as those with known vulnerabilities or deprecated technologies (e.g., ISC BIND, Apache HTTP Server, etc.). This data helps you quickly identify potential weakness in your external attack surface.
- **Services**: This section provides a tabulated list of services that are observed to be running on the asset. It includes details such as open ports and their associated services, allowing you to identify any risky or unsecured ports that should not be accessible from the internet (e.g., insecure remote services commonly targeted by attackers). Information such as port number, protocol, and dates when the open port was first and last observed is available.
- **SSL/TLS Certificates**: This section provides a tabulated list of SSL/TLS certificates used by the asset, highlighting old or outdated certificate versions that are often targeted by nefarious actors or versions that can be reverted to a previous version. The information provided includes SSL/TLS version, the server name protected by the certificate, issued date and expiration date for the certificate, and dates when the certificate was first and last observed in a scan.

Risk Insights
On the Risk tab, you can access information about the vulnerabilities and risks identified in the asset. This information helps you identify and remediate these issues by applying patches to mitigate the CVEs, retiring old technologies and services that are not in commission anymore, and adopting an access solution that can avoid exposure to unauthorized parties.
This tab includes an overview of the asset's risk metrics and a list of risk findings associated with the asset, as explained in the following sections:
- **Findings by Risk Level**: The findings associated with the asset plotted against risk levels in a bar graph, providing an overview of the distribution of findings across the risk levels. You can hover over each bar to view the number of findings marked with that specific risk level.
-
**Findings**: A tabulated list of all risk findings identified in the asset along with the number of findings indicated in the table header. This information provides visibility into all vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposures detected in the asset, helping you assess the asset's potential threat vectors and address the issues.
[Available Fields](#finding-details)
You can use the **Settings** icon to select the columns that must be shown or hidden from the asset table. In addition, you can sort the list by specific table columns using the **Sort** icon that appears in the column header.
[See image.](#assets-risk-tab-image)
-
[]**Approved**: Indicates that the asset comes under your organization's responsibility or management. Assets in this state are periodically scanned to update their inventory details and their connections are also scanned. After assets are attributed to your organization through the discovery process, they are validated by EASM and the verified assets are marked with this status.
All seed assets are marked as Approved by default.
- **Candidate**: Indicates that the asset needs further investigation into whether it comes under the responsibility of your organization. This is the default status for all attributed assets before they are validated and marked as Approved. Attributed assets are automatically validated by EASM after discovery. However, specific assets that are not validated by EASM need to be manually verified by admins. Additionally, if an asset's connection with your organization needs to be reviewed, you can change the asset's status to Candidate. Scanning of assets in this state is temporarily suspended, and the asset's successive connections are also not scanned.
- **Archived**: Indicates that the assets are reviewed and are confirmed to have no link to your organization, or can be permanently removed from scanning for other reasons. Assets in this state and their successive connections are removed from the scanning process.
[See image.](#asset-status-image)
Approved assets are continuously monitored and are given higher visibility in the EASM Admin Portal to help you easily identify, prioritize, and manage them. This is reflected in the [Assets Overview Dashboard](/easm/accessing-interacting-assets-overview-dashboard) that highlights key metrics on approved assets and the Assets page that lists the approved assets by default.
- []**Name**: An identifier for the finding sourced from the scan or assigned by EASM. Depending on the type of finding, this field can contain a wide variety of identifiers, such as CVE ID, VPN, Self-Signed Certificate, etc.
- **Risk Level**: The amount of risk quantified for the finding using one of the following values: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.
- **Category**: The classification of the finding as Exposure, Vulnerability, or Misconfiguration, which provides context about the finding instantly.
- **Scan Type**: The scanning service that was used to uncover the risk finding. The available scan types are Web, Network, Certificate, and DNS scans.
- **First Seen**: The timestamp when the finding was first detected in the asset.
- **Last Seen**: The timestamp when the finding was last observed in the asset.
You can access detailed information about each finding from the Findings page. To learn more, see [Understanding Finding Details](/easm/understanding-finding-details).
