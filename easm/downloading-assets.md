You can download the list of all assets that are part of your organization's external attack surface from the [Assets page](/easm/about-asset-inventory) as a CSV file. The data captured in the file directly replicates the table as it is displayed on the Assets page, reflecting any customization made through sorting, filtering, and selecting columns. This ensures that the downloaded file precisely mirrors the current view of the assets as seen on the page.
To download a list of assets in the CSV format:
- Go to the **Assets** page.
- To customize the asset list:
- Apply filters to display the assets that must be downloaded.
- Select the required columns from the **Column Chooser** to include the respective data of the assets in the downloaded file.
- Sort the list of asset records by a specific column using the **Sorting** icon in the column header.
-
Click the **Download** icon on the top-right corner of the page.
The assets are downloaded as a CSV file.
