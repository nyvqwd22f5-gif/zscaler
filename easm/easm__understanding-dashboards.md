Dashboards are essential tools for presenting key information from related data sources in a format that is easy to interpret, using various data visualization elements, such as graphs, tables, and charts. Zscaler EASM provides two dynamic and interactive dashboards, namely Assets Overview and Insights Overview. The Assets Overview dashboard provides a summary of the approved asset inventory that constitutes your organization's external attack surface, while the Insights Overview dashboard provides information on the vulnerabilities and risks associated with those assets. These dashboards are designed to aggregate and display key metrics related to assets and risk insights, helping you quickly identify areas of concern. By offering a near real-time view of your organization's evolving attack surface, these dashboards enable you to prioritize and address business-critical vulnerabilities, ensuring the protection of your internet-exposed asset infrastructure from potential threats.
The Assets Overview and Insights Overview dashboards serve as valuable starting points for identifying and understanding the threat landscape of your digital assets. Each dashboard features a collection of widgets specifically designed to present key metrics relating to assets or risk findings. These dashboards are highly interactive, allowing you to perform various actions within each widget, such as adjusting time frames, hovering over data points to view detailed information, and clicking on specific data points to access a filtered view of relevant entities on a different page in EASM. After identifying the most critical threats in your infrastructure using the information presented on the dashboard, you can drill down on the assets or risk findings for further analysis.
The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of each dashboard.
Insights Overview Dashboard
The Insights Overview dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of risk findings within your organization's digital attack surface, using clear graphical representations to highlight critical risk metrics. These findings include undetected vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance violations across your internet-exposed digital assets, which have been discovered and inventoried by EASM.
The dashboard presents key metrics across various parameters, such as risk trends, distribution of findings by risk levels and predefined categories, and the top locations with the highest concentration of risks. Additionally, it summarizes critical findings in specific areas, such as exposed sensitive services, VPN appliances, and risks associated with SSL/TLS certificate expiration and domain registration expiration. Specific examples of risk findings include Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), SSL/TLS misconfigurations or outdated versions, expired digital certificates, domain registration expiration, insecure HTTP headers, exposed VPN appliances, and sensitive services such as RDP, SSH, VNC, Telnet, and SNMP.
The dashboard also monitors lookalike domains—fraudulent domains created by bad actors to resemble legitimate domain names associated with your organization, which are often used to deceive users into downloading malware, divulging sensitive information, and perpetrating other forms of cyberattacks.
Each of these key metrics is displayed within an interactive widget on the dashboard, allowing you to drill down into specific data points for further analysis. You can easily switch between different EASM organizations by selecting the desired organization within the user interface, enabling you to effectively monitor and address the most critical threats to your infrastructure.

Assets Overview Dashboard
The Assets Overview dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of your organization's internet-facing digital assets, which have been verified as part of your digital infrastructure. This dashboard offers visibility into your external attack surface, presenting key metrics related to the risks and vulnerabilities associated with these assets. EASM uses advanced scanning techniques and intelligence-gathering tools to identify and analyze exposed assets across the internet, including unknown or forgotten assets. When discovered, these assets are inventoried, classified, and monitored through periodic scans. The latest data is then presented on the Assets Overview dashboard using graphical representations.
This dashboard allows you to quickly assess the security posture of your asset infrastructure, providing real-time updates on vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance violations. By offering a high-level view of your organization's external attack surface, the dashboard enables timely identification of business-critical assets and the remediation of vulnerabilities, helping to prevent potential exploits.
