In today's digital landscape, organizations face an ever-expanding attack surface due to rapid cloud adoption, the proliferation of shadow IT, and the continuous evolution of cyber threats. Zscaler External Attack Surface Management (EASM) addresses these challenges to help organizations gain visibility into and protect their internet-facing digital assets.
External Attack Surface Management refers to the continuous discovery, inventory, classification, and monitoring of an organization's digital assets that are exposed to the internet. These assets include domains, IP addresses, subdomains, SSL/TLS certificates, and more. EASM tools are crucial because they provide a real-time view of the external attack surface, helping organizations identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.
Zscaler EASM distinguishes itself by integrating advanced scanning techniques and intelligence gathering with Zscaler's Zero Trust Exchange (ZTE) platform. This integration allows the tool to not only identify exposed assets but also prioritize vulnerabilities based on the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact on the organization.
Key Features and Benefits
The key features and benefits offered by EASM for managing and securing your external attack surface are as follows:
- **Comprehensive Asset Discovery**: EASM uses both passive and active scanning methods to continuously discover and inventory all internet-facing assets. This includes not only known assets but also forgotten or unknown assets in your digital infrastructure that might have been overlooked.
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Unlike traditional vulnerability management tools that focus solely on severity, EASM employs a risk-based approach. It considers factors such as exploit likelihood, derived from sources like the CISA KEV catalog, to prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: EASM continuously monitors the discovered assets for changes or new vulnerabilities, providing real-time alerts to security teams. This proactive approach ensures that organizations can respond swiftly to emerging threats.
- **Actionable Insights**: EASM not only identifies vulnerabilities but also provides detailed remediation guidance. This includes suggestions for mitigating risks associated with misconfigurations, outdated software, and other security issues.
EASM Use Cases
The following use cases highlight how EASM empowers organizations in different scenarios to enhance their security posture:
- **Security Posture Management**: By providing a complete view of the external attack surface, EASM helps organizations manage their security posture effectively, ensuring that all internet-facing assets are secure and compliant.
- **M&A Diligence**: During mergers and acquisitions, EASM can be used to assess the security posture of the target company's digital footprint, identifying any potential risks that need to be addressed.
- **Continuous Compliance Monitoring**: EASM supports compliance efforts by continuously monitoring and reporting on the organization's external assets, helping to meet regulatory requirements.
