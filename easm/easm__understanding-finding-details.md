The findings that are uncovered in your digital attack surface as risks to your organization's security are investigated and cataloged in the [Findings page](/easm/about-findings) (Insights > Findings). This page features a highly customizable, tabulated list of findings, allowing you to click on each record to access detailed information about the finding and perform specific actions on a per-finding basis. The details provided for each finding are crucial for assessing the severity of risks, prioritizing them, and planning mitigation strategies. Additionally, each finding is also mapped to the assets affected by the finding in a many-to-many relationship (i.e., one finding can impact multiple assets and vice-versa).
The finding details are presented in two distinct views, offering users the flexibility to drill down on the finding details as required. When you click on a row in the findings table, a quick view of essential information about the finding opens in a right-side drawer (referred to as "Finding Details drawer" henceforth). This drawer features a tabbed interface for finding details and impacted assets. To further drill down on the finding information, from the Finding Details drawer, you can access a full-page view of comprehensive details about the finding (referred to as "Finding Details page" henceforth). To do this, you need to click the View More Details button on the Finding Details tab of the Finding Details drawer.

The Finding Details page provides extensive information about the finding and also mirrors the tabbed interface for finding details and impacted assets, as seen in the Finding Details drawer. The Finding Details drawer is essentially a limited version of the Finding Details page and allows you to easily switch between different findings to view their details from the list view. On the other hand, the Finding Details page is more useful when analyzing a specific finding, and you need to access the complete data available for the finding. When you are on the Finding Details page, you can go back to the findings list view to access details of other findings.

The next sections cover all the finding details that are available, following the presentation layout and the comprehensive information tracked on the Finding Details page. On the Finding Details page (Insights > [Finding] > Finding Details > View More Details), the finding name is displayed at the top along with the finding's overview, details, and impacted assets.
Some of the following documented fields are only available on the Finding Details page and are not present in the Finding Details drawer. Additionally, the organization of the content differs between the two views.
Finding Overview
This section contains high-level information about the finding to help users get a baseline of the finding at a glance. This section includes:
- **Category/Type**: The classification of the finding as **Exposure**, **Vulnerability**, or **Misconfiguration**, which provides context about the finding instantly. Each category of findings is uniquely processed and has slightly varying information presented for the findings within that category based on relevance. For example, the NVD CVSS Severity, CISA KEV Likelihood, and EPSS Likelihood are all most relevant to vulnerability findings rather than exposures or misconfigurations.
- **Risk Level**: The risk level quantifies the amount of risk associated with a finding, and it is derived from the risk score computed for the finding. The risk level ranges from **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, and **Critical**. Risk levels help you with instant information about prioritizing business-critical findings. For example, a critical or high risk level indicates that the finding poses significant risk without mitigation controls, whereas a low risk level might indicate an acceptable risk. A medium risk level might indicate that the issue needs to be resolved to improve your security defenses but might have a lower priority compared to serious risks.
- **Impacted Asset**: The asset impacted by the risk finding. Assets and findings can have many-to-many relationships (i.e., one finding can impact multiple assets and an asset can have multiple findings), and the complete list of assets impacted by the finding is listed under the **Other Impacted Assets** tab along with the count of assets displayed in the tab name.
- **First Seen**: The timestamp of when the finding was first detected during scanning, adding more context to understanding the interaction with the finding.
- **Last Seen**: The timestamp when the finding was last detected during scanning, adding more context to understanding the interaction with the finding.
- **Finding Age**: The number of days elapsed since the first encounter with the finding until it was last seen, indicating how long the finding has been present in your asset infrastructure.
-
**Status**: Indicates the current stage in which the finding is present from discovery to closure. You can modify the status of the finding using the drop-down menu.

Finding Details
On the Details tab, you can find crucial information about the finding that provides more context about the finding to help you understand and analyze the finding more in depth. This section includes:
- **Finding Risk Score**: A risk score computed for the finding based on multiple vectors such as threat severity, likelihood, and impact using a combination of open source intelligence (OSINT) on vulnerability risk computation and Zscaler's proprietary risk computation techniques. The risk score is a numerical value ranging from 1 to 100. The risk score is shown in a half donut chart with the risk score and risk level presented at the center and an indicator used to point towards the color-coded risk score meter in the donut chart.
- **Scan Type**: The scanning service that was used to uncover the risk. The available scan types are **Web**, **Network**, **Certificate**, and **DNS** scans. For example, domain expiration is likely to be detected in a DNS scan, SSL/TLS outdated version might be detected in a web scan, and a CVE vulnerability might be detected in a web, DNS, or network scan.
- **NVD CVSS Severity**: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score that indicates the qualitative measure of severity of a vulnerability using a numerical value ranging from 1 to 10, if applicable.
- **CISA KEV Likelihood**: Indicates whether a vulnerability is listed in the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) using a Boolean value, if applicable.
- **EPSS Likelihood**: The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) likelihood indicates the probability that a vulnerability can be exploited in the wild, if applicable. The value is represented in a percentage.
- **Description**: A detailed description of the finding gathered from an open-source intelligence, such as [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/), and Zscaler's research team.
- **[Scan Output]**: This section contains the complete output of the scan that was used to identify the finding. This section is labeled differently for assets depending on their type and the corresponding scan performed (e.g., HTTP Response, Nmap Response, and Certificate Response).
- **Matched Evidence**: This section contains specific portions of the scan results that attest to the finding. This information provides attestation of detected findings and enables organizations to self-validate their findings using the investigative trail provided.

Specific finding details, such as NVD CVSS Severity, CISA KEV Likelihood, and EPSS Likelihood are only applicable to vulnerability findings which group Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). CVE is a list of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities maintained by MITRE.
Impacted Assets
On the **Other Impacted Assets** tab, you can access the list of all assets that are impacted by the risk, excluding the asset that's already displayed in the Overview section. This section provides visibility into how widely the risk is spread within your asset infrastructure by aggregating the risk impact. The assets are tabulated, and the following information is available for each asset.
[Available Fields](#asset-fields)
The number of assets that are impacted by the risk is included in the tab name. You can use the **Settings** icon to select the columns that must be shown or hidden from the asset table. In addition, you can sort the list by specific table columns using the **Sort** icon that appears in the column header.

- []**Not Verified**: All the risk findings identified by EASM in your organization's attack surface are tagged with the label, Not Verified.
- **Verified**: Risk findings are investigated manually and are verified to be present (e.g., verifying an open port flagged on a host).
- **Risk Accepted**: Represents risk findings that are deemed acceptable. For example, a jump server with port 22 open and exposed to the internet might be for intended use.
- **Resolved**: Risk findings for which remediation steps are taken or are planned can be marked as resolved. With the previous example, if the server is planned to be moved behind Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) as a resolution, then it could be marked as resolved. However, if the finding is discovered again in a subsequent scan, then it is marked as Not Verified.
- **Disputed**: If the manual verification of the finding turns out different from the risk finding, the finding can be moved to the Disputed status, indicating that it might be a false positive.
[See image.](#findings-statuses-overview-image)
The Insights Overview dashboard presents data on findings that are in Not Verified and Verified statuses to highlight risks that need to be addressed to eliminate threats and penetration by bad actors into your network. Findings that are in Risk Accepted, Resolved, or Disputed statuses are not presented in the dashboard, as these risks are considered as not requiring any further actions from your security team. However, risks in these statuses can be moved to Not Verified or Verified if they require further examination. To learn more, see [Modifying Finding Status](/easm/modifying-finding-status).
- []**Name**: The name of the asset.
- **Risk Level**: The risk level assigned to the asset.
- **Scan Type**: The type of scan through which the asset was discovered, such as Web, DNS, or Network type scans.
- **Status**: The [status](/easm/changing-asset-status) of the asset from Approved, Candidate, or Archived.
- **First Seen**: The timestamp when the finding was first detected in the asset.
- **Last Seen**: The timestamp when the finding was last observed in the asset.
You can access detailed information about each asset from the Assets page. To learn more, see [Understanding Asset Details](/easm/understanding-asset-details).
