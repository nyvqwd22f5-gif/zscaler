When your organization's assets are discovered, EASM maps them to your external attack surface by assigning the Approved status to the assets. The asset status allows you to manage your external attack surface by reviewing whether the assets should be included as part of the particular organization's external attack surface. Additionally, EASM offers a distinct advantage by uniquely monitoring and processing assets across various statuses. This enables your organization to maintain clear visibility into the most critical assets that are directly under your responsibility. The following three statuses are supported for assets, and assets can be transitioned from one status to any other status depending on the requirements:
- [Approved](#approved)
- [Candidate](#candidate)
- [Archived](#archived)
You can view and manage all assets across all statuses from the Assets page. By default, the assets page is filtered to show only the approved assets. You can use the Status filter to include Candidate and Archived assets. To learn more, see [Filtering & Customizing the Assets Page](/easm/filtering-customizing-assets-page). You can modify the status of individual assets from the Asset Details drawer or the Asset Details page.
To modify the status of an asset:
The data on the Assets page corresponds to your organization selected on the top-right corner. Before you begin, ensure that the desired organization is selected.
- Go to the **Assets** page.
-
Click the asset record for which you want to modify the status.
The Asset Details drawer opens on the right side.
-
In the Asset Details drawer, under the **Asset Details** tab, you can modify the asset's status by using the **Status** drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can click the **View More Details** button to go to the asset details page and modify the status from there.

A **Status Update Confirmation** window appears.
- In the **Status Update Confirmation** window, enter the reason for modifying the asset's status which can be useful for auditing trails and general tracking purposes.
- Click **Accept**.
[]**Approved**: Indicates that the asset comes under the responsibility or management of your organization. Assets in this state are periodically scanned to update their inventory details and their connections are also scanned. After assets are attributed to your organization through the discovery process, they are validated by EASM and the verified assets are marked with this status. Approved assets that are identified as forming your external attack surface are closely monitored and are given higher visibility in the EASM Admin Portal to help you easily identify, prioritize, and manage them. This is reflected in the [Assets Overview dashboard](/easm/accessing-interacting-assets-overview-dashboard), which provides insights into critical assets on the attack surface by highlighting key metrics on approved assets and the [Assets page](/easm/about-asset-inventory) that lists the approved assets by default.
All seed assets are marked as approved by default.
[]**Candidate**: Indicates that the asset needs further review and investigation into whether it comes under your organization's responsibility. This is the default status for all attributed assets before they are validated and marked as approved. Attributed assets are automatically validated by EASM after discovery. However, specific assets that are not validated by EASM need to be manually verified by admins. Additionally, you can review approved assets and manually change the status to Candidate if you want to investigate the asset's link to your organization or if the asset is not established to have a strong connection with your organization. Candidate assets are not included in periodic scans and are no longer part of the discovery chain that's established by its initial connection to the seed. Scanning of assets in this state is temporarily suspended, and the asset's successive connections are also not scanned.
[]**Archived**: Assets that are reviewed confirmed to have no relationship with your organization or that no longer require monitoring can be marked as Archived. Assets in this state and their successive connections are removed from the scanning process. Archived assets are also not included in scanning and are not part of the discovery chain established by their original connection to the seed. Archived assets and their successive connections are permanently removed from the scanning process.
