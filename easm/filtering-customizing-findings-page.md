The [Findings page](/easm/about-findings) includes a set of filtering options that allows you to view a subset of data that match a specified criteria. You can set the criteria based on specific parameters of findings such as risk level, last seen, category, and type. These parameters can be applied individually or together to the Findings table to filter the data. After building a search query using the filters, you can optionally save the query as a custom filter to reuse it in the future for routine tasks. In addition, you can customize the table columns by choosing to show or hide specific columns in the table and by reordering and sorting the columns.
The following sections describe how to apply filters on findings and how to customize the Findings table columns.
The data on the Findings page corresponds to your organization selected on the top-right corner. Before you begin, ensure that the desired organization is selected.
Applying Filters
On the Findings page (Insights > Findings), you can select the required filters and select appropriate values to apply the filters. The mode of selection varies across the filters with some filters using single select drop-down, while other filters support multiple select drop-down from a predefined set of options. Some filters also support the use of logical operators to build more specific queries by manually entering the required values for match criteria.
The following filters are available:
- **Status**: Filters the findings based on their status. This filter allows you to select multiple values simultaneously by using the respective checkboxes. The following statuses are available for findings: Not Verified, Verified, and Risk Accepted, Resolved, and Disputed.
-
**Risk Level**: Filters the findings based on their criticality into Low, Medium, High, and Critical risk levels, depending on the values chosen. This filter allows you to select multiple values simultaneously by using the respective checkboxes. The risk level assigned to a finding is based on the dynamic risk score generated for the finding.
[Mapping between Risk Level and Risk Score](#riskLevel-riskScore-mapping)
- **Last Seen**: Filters the findings based on when they were last detected in the EASM asset scan. This filter allows you to obtain the list of findings that were observed in the most recent scans (within the last 7 days or 30 days) to a much greater range of timeline of 1 year. This filter supports single value selection using a drop-down menu and comes with the following options: Within 7 Days, Within 30 Days, Within 90 Days, and Within 1 Year.
-
**Category**: Filters the findings based on the category assigned to them by EASM, allowing you to view the findings based on context. For example, you can get a list of all findings classified as vulnerabilities or misconfigurations using this filter. The categories available are:
- **Exposure**: Shows the percentage of business-critical services, such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, and VPN services, MySQL data stores, revealing hostnames, etc.
- **Misconfiguration**: Shows the percentage of outdated SSL/TLS versions, SSL/TLS certificate expirations, domain registration expiration, usage of self-signed certificates, absence of common security headers in HTTP requests including but not limited to HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), X-XSS-Protection, Set-Cookie, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP), Permissions-Policy, etc.
- **Vulnerability**: Shows the percentage of vulnerabilities that are part of the CVE database.
This filter supports single value selection using a drop-down menu.
-
**Type**: Filters the findings based on the type into which the finding is classified by EASM. While Categories are broader classifications of findings, Types are sub-classifications of findings within specific Categories which enables a more specific categorization of findings. For example, if you want to view misconfigurations of a specific kind, such as expired SSL/TLS certificate, you can simply choose the type filter as Expired SSL/TLS Certificate.
Zscaler uses a number of types to classify the findings, and this list is constantly updated based on new vulnerability and exploit discoveries and threat intelligence information. You can view the current list of filtering options available within Type by clicking this filter on the Findings page of the EASM Admin Portal.

Customizing Table Columns
You can customize the columns that appear within the Findings table by using the following options:
- Choose the columns that must be shown within the table by clicking the **Settings** icon in the top-right corner. In the **Column Chooser** window that appears, you can click on the columns to add or remove them from the table. The table refreshes and displays the new column set. The **Name** column is always shown and cannot be modified.
-
Sort the list by a specific column in an alphabetical or numerical order by using the **Sort** icon shown in the column header. The sorting option is available only for specific columns, indicated by the **Sort** icon displayed next to the column name.
To appropriately sort the columns, ensure that only one column is sorted at a time and deselect the **Sort** icon for other columns which use the functionality simultaneously.
