Adding labels is optional when configuring Workflow Automation. Admins with access to Workflow Automation can manage custom labels and the values associated with those labels. After you add labels, you can assign those labels to the different incidents that have occurred in your organization on the Incidents page and the Incident Details page. To learn more, see [About Incidents](/zia/about-incidents) and [Viewing & Managing Incident Details](/zia/viewing-managing-incident-details).
Adding Labels
To add a label:
-
Go to **Setup** > **Labels**. The **Labels** page appears, listing all the labels for your organization.

Editing Labels
To edit the label:
- Go to **Setup** > **Labels**. The **Labels** page appears, listing all the labels for your organization.
- (Optional) On the **Labels** page, use the **Search** field to locate the label for which you want to edit.
- Click the **Edit** icon next to the label. The **Edit Label** window appears.
- Change the **Label Name** field for the label or change the values for the label by doing one of these options:
- To edit a label value, double-click an existing label value, edit the value, and then press `Tab` or press `Enter`.
- To add another value to the label, click **Add More** in the **Label Values** field for the label, enter the new value, and then press `Tab` or press `Enter`.
- To delete a value associated with the label, click the **Delete** icon next to a value that is displayed for the label.

- Click **Update.**
To delete the entire label along with its associated values, click the **Delete** icon next to the label on the **Labels** page.
If you delete the entire label, there might still be incidents in Workflow Automation that were previously assigned to that label on the **Incidents** page or the **Incident Details** page. You need to manually find those incidents and remove the label that was deleted. To learn more, see [About Incidents](/zia/about-incidents) and [Viewing & Managing Incident Details](/zia/viewing-managing-incident-details).
Viewing Labels
To view labels, go to **Setup** >** Labels**. The **Labels** page appears, listing all the labels for your organization. For labels, you can view the following information:
- **Label Name**: The name of the label.
- **Label Value**: The values associated with the label.
