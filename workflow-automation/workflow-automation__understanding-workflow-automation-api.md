The Workflow Automation API gives you programmatic access to manage DLP incidents created in your organization. DLP incidents are transactions that have violated the Data Protection (DLP and SaaS API) policies configured by your organization in Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). The admin to whom a DLP incident is assigned can take various actions to resolve the incident using Workflow Automation API. To learn more, see:
