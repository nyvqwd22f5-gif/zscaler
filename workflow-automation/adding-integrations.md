The Integration page allows you to add the source of the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) incidents to Workflow Automation. Admins with full or restricted access can configure the DLP AWS, Azure, and GCP application integrations to manage the organization's DLP incidents that appear on the Incidents page. To learn more, see:
- [Managing DLP Amazon Web Services Application Integrations in Workflow Automation](/workflow-automation/managing-dlp-aws-application-integrations-workflow-automation)
- [Managing DLP Azure Application Integrations in Workflow Automation](/workflow-automation/managing-dlp-azure-application-integrations-workflow-automation)
- [Managing DLP GCP Application Integrations in Workflow Automation](/workflow-automation/managing-dlp-gcp-application-integrations-workflow-automation)
You can also integrate Workflow Automation with SaaS applications sanctioned for Zscaler. The applications available within Workflow Automation are ServiceNow and Jira Software. During the remediation process for a data-protection incident, admins use these ticketing systems to create and assign tickets to the incident. To learn more, see:
