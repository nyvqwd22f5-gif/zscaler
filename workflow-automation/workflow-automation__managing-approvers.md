Adding approvers in Workflow Automation is one of the tasks for configuring Workflow Automation. Admins with access to Workflow Automation need to configure the approvers for their organization in Workflow Automation.
While investigating an incident on the Incidents page or Incident Details page, admins can escalate the incident to an approver for their review and response to the incident. Approvers can be anyone that you choose. For example, an approver can be the manager of the end user who generated the incident. To learn more, see [About Incidents](/zia/about-incidents) and [Viewing & Managing Incident Details](/zia/viewing-managing-incident-details).
