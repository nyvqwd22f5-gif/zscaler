Adding priorities to event groups is one of the tasks you must complete for configuring Workflow Automation. Admins with full access to Workflow Automation can add a priority to all the different event groups for their organization. After priorities have been assigned, admins can then filter the events they are responsible for by priority on the [Events](/workflow-automation/managing-events) page of the Workflow Automation Admin Portal.
Before managing priorities, you must configure event groups on the [Event Groups](/workflow-automation/managing-event-groups) page.
On the Priorities page, you can do the following:
- [View Event Group Priorities](#viewing-priority)
- [Add Event Group Priorities](#adding-priority)
- [Edit Event Group Priorities](#editing-priority)
[]To add an event group priority:
- Go to **Setup** > **Priorities**. The **Priorities** page appears, listing all the event groups and their assigned priorities for your organization.
-
On the **Priorities** page, click **Add More**. A new row appears after the last event group that is displayed.

- In the new row:
- **Event Group**: From the drop-down menu, select an event group.
- **Priority**: Select a **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** priority for the event group.
- Click **Save**.
[]To edit an event group priority:
- Go to **Setup** > **Priorities**. The **Priorities** page appears, listing all the event groups and their assigned priorities for your organization.
- (Optional) On the **Priorities** page, use the **Search** field to locate the event group for which you want to edit the priority.
-
Next to the event group, select a different **Priority**.

You can also use the **Events Group** drop-down menu to change the event group. If you change the event group, the priority is removed from the previous event group and added to the new event group.
- Click **Save**.
To delete an event group priority configuration, click the **Delete** icon next to a priority configuration.
[]To view event group priorities:
- Go to **Setup** > **Priorities**. The **Priorities** page appears, listing all the event groups and their assigned priorities for your organization.
-
For each event group, you can view:
- **Event Group**: The name of the event group.
- **Priority**: The priority assigned to the event group. Priorities are **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**.
