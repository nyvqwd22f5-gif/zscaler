The API Keys page provides a repository for an organization to store created API keys. An API key consists of a Key ID and Key Secret. These two items are required for authenticating Workflow Automation APIs.
The API key can only be generated in the Workflow Automation Admin Portal from the API Keys page. Key IDs are always accessible from the page, but key secrets are only available when the API key is first created, and they are not available in the saved configuration.
Workflow Automation API Keys provide the following benefits and enable you to:
- Provide a repository of generated, authorized API keys for programmatic access to Workflow Automation API.
- Maintain accessibility to the API keys by enabling or disabling them as required.
- Prevent the misuse of API services by regenerating the API key whenever required or when you suspect vulnerabilities for an attack.
- Ensure no further API requests are possible after you have utilized the API services by deleting the API key.
