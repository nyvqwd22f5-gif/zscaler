Event groups enable admins to group individual events together so that all of them can be managed in one place. Admins can map event groups to one or more of the attributes available in an event.
Event groups are also used to map the priority for events. To learn more, see [Managing Priorities for Events](/workflow-automation/managing-priorities-events).
