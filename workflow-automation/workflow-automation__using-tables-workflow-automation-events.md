In the Workflow Automation Admin Portal, events and event details are organized and displayed in a table on the [Events](/workflow-automation/managing-events) and [Event Details](/workflow-automation/managing-event-details) pages. To modify the settings for the table, do the following:
- [Reorder Columns](#reorder)
- [Resize Columns](#resize)
- [Hide Columns](#hide)
- [Sort the Column Data](#sort)
- [Configure the Number of Table Rows](#Configure-Number-of-Rows)
[]To reorder columns:
-
In the upper-right corner of the table, Click the **Table Options** icon. The **Table Options** dialog appears.
[See image.](#reorder-column-image)
- In the **Table Options** dialog, hover over a listed column name, then drag and drop the column to the desired position. After you drop the column name, the table refreshes and displays the data in the new column order.
[]When the data in a column takes up more space than the viewing area allows, it gets clipped. You can increase the column width to view all the data.
To resize the column width:
- Hover over the right border of the column on the table. A **Resize** icon appears.
-
Drag and drop to the desired column width.

[]When you do not need to view all the columns at once, you can hide them so only the columns you want to view are visible.
To hide columns:
- In the upper-right corner of the table, click the **Table Options** icon. The **Table Options** dialog appears.
-
Uncheck the column names you want to hide. After you click the checkbox, the table refreshes and displays only the checked columns.

[]All column headers have a **Sort** icon next to them. These icons indicate that you can sort the data in those columns. You can sort data in ascending or descending order.
To sort a column, click the **Sort** icon in the table column header.

[]The number of rows that appear in the table is configurable.
To configure the number of table rows:
- In the upper-right corner of the table, click the **Table Options** icon. The **Table Options** dialog appears.
-
Select the **Rows** tab.
[See image.](#configure-rows-image)
- Select the number of rows to display on the page. Available row options are 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100. After you select the option, the page refreshes displaying that number of rows.
