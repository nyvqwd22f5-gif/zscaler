The Integration page allows you to integrate Workflow Automation with the SaaS application ServiceNow, sanctioned by Zscaler. For Business Insights events that are captured in Workflow Automation, Business Insights admins can configure the ServiceNow ticketing system with automated workflows to create and assign tickets for every event.
