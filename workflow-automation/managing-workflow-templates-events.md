Workflow templates are used as the basis for the workflows you add in Workflow Automation. To add a workflow for your organization, you must use the template provided on the Workflow Templates page. Admins use the workflows that are added and mapped to assist them with resolution of the Business Insights events that occur in your organization.
Workflow Automation provides the **Notify Users and Create a Ticket** workflow template. To learn more, see [Understanding Workflows for Events](/workflow-automation/understanding-workflows-events).
On the Workflow Templates page, admins can:
- [View Workflow Templates](#heading-view-workflow-templates)
- [View Workflow Template Definitions](#heading-view-workflow-template-definitions)
- [Add Workflows](#add-workflow)
[]To view workflow templates:
Go to **Workflows** > **Workflow Templates**. The **Workflow Templates** page appears, listing all the workflow templates provided by Workflow Automation.
For workflow templates, you can view:
- **Template Name**: The name of the template.
- **Template Description**: The description of the template.
- **Counts**: The number of workflow definitions that have been created using this workflow template.
