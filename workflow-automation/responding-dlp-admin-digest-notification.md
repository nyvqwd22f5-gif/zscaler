The format of the notification might not be the same as illustrated in this article. It depends upon the notification template configured by your organization in the Workflow Automation Admin Portal.
Workflow Automation can send DLP admin digest notifications to admins if they have assigned incidents using a DLP admin digest notification template. Before a DLP admin digest notification can be sent to an admin, the DLP Admin Digest Notification Flags field must be enabled on the Account Settings page, and the admin's DLP admin digest settings (digest frequency, channel, and priority) must be configured for the admin on the Admins page. An admin's DLP admin digest settings specify the frequency and channel for their DLP admin digest notifications, as well as the incident priorities to include in their DLP admin digest notifications.
Workflow Automation provides default DLP admin digest notification templates (DLP Admin Digest - Email Template, DLP Admin Digest - Slack Template, and DLP Admin Digest - Teams Template) that you can clone and use for these notifications. These default digest notifications list the number of all new incidents for the admin, the number of all open incidents for the admin, and the number of state changes, and provide a link to the Incident page where the admin can view and manage these incidents. The DLP admin digest notifications contain the same information, but the format of the message is different and where the notification is delivered is different. To learn more, see [Managing Account Settings](/workflow-automation/managing-account-settings), [Managing Notification Templates](/workflow-automation/managing-notification-templates), [Managing Incident and Digest Template Mappings](/workflow-automation/managing-incident-and-digest-template-mappings), and [Managing Admin Assignments](/workflow-automation/managing-admin-assignments).
Viewing the DLP Admin Digest Notification
If you have assigned incidents, a DLP admin digest notification (e.g., email, Slack message, or Microsoft Teams message) is sent to you at the frequency specified for you on the Admins page. The digest notification contains the following information:
- The number of new incidents that require your attention.
- The number of open incidents that require your attention.
- The number of state changes associated with those incidents.
- The incidents link, where you can view and manage those incidents. This link is only valid for 24 hours.
The incident count provided in the message is accurate as of the date and time the notification is generated. However, the count is subject to change as new incidents are created, reassigned, or resolved.
The following images are examples of a DLP admin digest notification email, Slack message, and Microsoft Teams message. The DLP admin digest notifications contain the same information, but the format of the message is different.

The digest notification emails can be tagged as spam and sent to your spam folder based on your email settings. Change your settings to receive the digest notification emails directly in your inbox.
Viewing the Incidents
To view the incidents, click the **View all incidents assigned to me **link provided in the notification. You are redirected to the **Incident** page. The **Incident** page appears, listing all the incidents that require your attention. For each incident, you can view:
- **Last Change Date**: The date and time the incident was last changed.
