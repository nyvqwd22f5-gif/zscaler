Zscaler Copilot Use
This AUP governs the access and use of interactive AI powered chatbot within Zscaler Products (“Zscaler Copilot”)
Please be advised that Zscaler Copilot is an artificial intelligence chatbot assistant, not a human. While Zscaler Copilot will do its best to assist you, it is a machine learning model without subjective experiences and its outputs are based on generative AI models. By using Zscaler Copilot, you understand and accept that responses may be incomplete, inaccurate, and/or inappropriate as set out in the [Product Output Disclaimer](/legal/product-output-disclaimer). For your privacy and security, do not share any personal or sensitive information.
When using Zscaler Copilot, you may not access, use, or enable others to access or use the Zscaler Copilot in any manner that would be in conflict with these rules:
-
**Comply with applicable laws**
Do not violate any applicable law (including but not limited to any manner that promotes, contributes to, or encourages illegal or unlawful activity), including conduct that describes, encourages, supports, or distributes in any form child sexual abuse materials. Do not override safety or privacy filters, controls, or mechanisms.
-
**Do not use Zscaler Copilot to harm**
Do not generate, promote, disseminate, or otherwise use or facilitate (1) content that may harm other individuals; (2) adult content, such as erotic chat, pornography, and content meant to arouse sexual excitement; (3) content that may violate or infringe upon the rights of others (including but not limited to intellectual property rights and privacy rights); (4) content that may present a risk of death or bodily harm to individuals (including in relation to illegal drugs, weapons, or self-harm); and (5) other harmful content.
Do not deceive or mislead others, including but not limited to activity related to plagiarism, scams, phishing or malware, and furtherance of misinformation.
Do not solicit professional advice (including but not limited to medical, financial, or legal advice) or content to be used for the purpose of engaging in other regulated activities (including but not limited to political campaigning or lobbying). If searching for important information always verify it from authoritative sources, as the chatbot may provide inaccurate or outdated information.
-

Any attempts to exploit the chatbot for malicious purposes like system interference, hacking or distributing malware are not allowed. Similarly, using chatbot interactions for creating training data for other AI systems without Zscaler’s permission is not allowed.
-
**Respect the safeguards**
Do not circumvent any safeguards or safety mitigations put in place. Our Zscaler Copilot's responses are generated based on its training, and Zscaler doesn't guarantee complete accuracy or appropriateness of the generated output. Zscaler reserves rights to monitor chatbot interactions and suspend/terminate access for policy violations.

Customers should not upload or input sensitive personal information as defined by applicable data privacy laws into Zscaler Copilot. Please ensure that Customer employees and users abide by Customer’s internal data security and privacy policies.
